thank you so much
it is really a great delight
to be here with olive you and with my
fellow candidates I want to congratulate
all the inductees and
and a thank you for what you're doing to
bring back to Democratic Party and Iowa
the
just look around this room
and you can see that democrats are
united
where energized and we are ready HO way
and this election
now I know and you do as well that
elections are always about the future
but this time
I feel that even more powerful E maybe
it's because our country as works so
hard
to come back from the financial crisis
with President Obama's leadership and
the determination of the American people
where standing again the
but we're not yet running
the way america should and now we have
to choose
whether we're going to return to the
failed
top-down policies that wrecked our
economy before
or move forward to chart a stronger
fairer and more prosperous future now
maybe it is the grandmother and made but
this is deeply
personal there's something about
becoming a grand parent it is truly
transformational someone you know what
I'm talking about
it anchors you in the present and you
suddenly have this incredible amazing
little person who commands a lot of
attention
but it also forces you to think about
the future
in a new way what kind I've
world will be waiting for her what kind
of country
will we have when she becomes an adult
and what are our responsibilities to
shape that
I'm thinking a lot these days
about my own mother and what she did for
me
abandoned and mistreated by her own
family
she was out on her own by 14
working as a housemaid but she didn't
givin to bitterness or despair
and I remember asking her how did you
keep
your resilience how did you keep your
faith in the goodness of people and a
future
that would be better in the past and
here's what
she said someone
along the way believed she mattered
the first grade teacher who saw she had
nothing to eat
at lunch and without embarrassing her
brought extra food to share the woman
whose house she cleaned suggesting she
go
to high school so long as her work
was done and because those people
believed
in her she was able to believe
in me and to give me that great gift
a believing in others and in our country
so my mom wasn't surprised that my first
job out of law school was at the
children's defense fund
she wasn't surprised that I've spent my
life
fighting for women and children families
and our country after all that's what
she taught me to do
and she never stopped pushing me to
fight
harder for others to have the same
opportunities she never had
I can still hear her saying
lives not about what happens to you it's
about what you do
with what happens to you cell get back
out there
and that's why I'm here with you
today the
that's why I'm so determined to build a
better future
catch just for my granddaughter but for
all love our children and grandchildren
and that's why
I'm never going to let the republicans
rip away the progress we have made
the
you know we democrats are in the future
business
but from the republican candidates for
president we see the opposite
now they may have some fresh faces
but they are the party up the past
we democrats we look at america
and we see limitless potential we
believe
in a basic bargain if you work hard
and do your part you should be able to
get ahead
and stay ahead and we believe that the
measure
up our 6s should be how much
incomes rise for hard-working families
not just for CEOs and money managers
the
well republicans believe something
very different their answer
is always the same cut taxes for the
super wealthy
let big corporations right their own
rules
that's it trickle-down economics has to
be one of the worst
ideas up the 1980s the
it is right up there with new call
shoulder pads and big hair
I lived through it
and there are photographs and we're not
going back to that
this past Monday I laid out an agenda
for raising incomes
so hard working americans can afford
a middle-class life an agenda for strong
growth
fair growth and long-term growth that
will be my mission from the first day
I'm president
to the last and this campaign
hasta
how we unlocked the potential I've
every American because bad is how
we unlock the potential America itself
now I'm having I'm having a great debate
already with republicans about what that
means for our country
in the past week governor bush scramble
to explain his statement
that americans need to work longer hours
he now says he just wants part time
workers to be able to find
full-time jobs well so do I there's just
one problem:
his policies and the policies are all
these republican candidates
would make that harder giving more tax
cuts to those at the top
won't do anything four-part Turner
part-time workers
rolling back rules for Wall Street will
not help families
get ahead and getting red
up the Affordable Care Act certainly
won't help
entrepreneurs just ask the folks in the
sharing economy
Americans don't need lectures
they need raises the
so if Republicans really want to help us
why don't they
join us in breaking down the barriers
so more americans can enter and succeed
in the workforce
especially women now
now I know that when I
talk about this some people think I can
see it in their eyes
there she goes again with the women's
issues
well I'm not going to stop so get ready
for a long campaign
the
you see I have this I have this
old-fashioned idea we can't afford to
leave
anyone on the sidelines and women who
want to work should be
able to do sell without worrying
everyday about how they're going to take
care of their child or
what will happen if a family member gets
sick
that's not a luxury it's a growth
strategy
paid bleach earned sick days
child-care minimum wage these are not
women's issues their family issues
and their economic issues the
so I will keep fighting for them and ask
you
to joy and I'm going to keep fighting
for equal pay because when women get
short-changed families get shortchange
and when families get shortchanged our
economy
and our country get shortchanged
unlocking potential though
goes beyond dollars and cents it really
is about our values
how we treat each other the kind of
country we want to build
and that historic day last month when
marriage equality
became the law of the land
Republican candidates were complaining
not sharing we even
her to call for abolishing the Supreme
Court
itself instead have
trying to turn the clock back
republicans
should be joining us in saying loudly
and
clearly Knoll to discrimination once and
for all
LGBT Americans
should be free not just to marry
but to live learn and
work just like everybody else
the
and then there's immigration we've heard
a lot recently from the new Republican
front-runner
donald Trump finely
a candidate whose hair gets more
attention
than mine the in
but there's nothing funny about the
haiti is
spewing toward immigrants and their
families it really is shameful
and so is the fact that it took weeks
for most of his fellow Republican
candidates to stand up to him
the sad truth is if you look
at many up their policies it is hard
to tell the difference just look across
the border
in Wisconsin
Governor Walker kicked off his campaign
by rolling back
reproductive rights for women and
stripping
union workers up their rights we don't
need
anymore politicians who shame and blame
women for making
our own reproductive health decisions or
attacking unions for fighting for
middle-class jobs
the
and
and I know there are challenges right
here
in iowa because you've been talking to
me about them just listen to this
Iowa has fewer
than 750 beds
for more than 120
aid thousand people in your state
with serious mental illnesses families
worry about relatives who need help in
can't get it
and the I ones I've talked to
don't understand why your governor would
veto a bipartisan compromise without
funding a viable alternative and that's
not all
the government also said no to investing
and I was students teachers and schools
so tonight I'm adding my boys to yours
governor branstad put down your veto pen
the
the
I love families don't need a standoff
they need solutions the
that's why we can't wear cascade Cascade
like they're trying to do we are not
going back to trickle-down economics are
the wild west on wall street where not
going back
to insurance companies charging women
more for the same coverage
we're not going back to denying climate
change
if you ask most of these republican
candidates about that they'll say sorry
I'm not a scientist well then why don't
they start listening to those who are
scientists
the
look I'm not a scientist either I'm just
a grandmother with two eyes and a brain
and I'm not gonna let them take us
backwards
the
democrats join me let's build up our
party in every corner of this state and
country
elect Democrats at every level take back
school board's and statehouses
all the way to the White House I'm
running to make our country work for you
and for every american for the
struggling
a striving and the successful for the
factory workers in the fold servers who
have taken care about us tonight
for the back trends have served our
country for the farmers
will feed us and the small business work
owners who take a rest
for the nurses who work the night shift
in the truckers you drive for
hours I am running for everyone who's
ever been knocked down but refused to be
knocked out
I'm running for you were gonna build
America
where we don't leave anyone out our
anyone behind
where view work are you well do your
part and get ahead
and where a father can tell his daughter
yes you can be anything you want to be
even president Ave oneida stay
thank you all very much
there answer is always the same
cut taxes for the super wealthy
let big corporations right their own
rules
that's it trickle-down economics has to
be one of the worst
ideas up the 1980s
