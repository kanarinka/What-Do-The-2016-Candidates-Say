wow this is a great way to start my day
day and I'm delighted to be here with
you
I wanna thank Mark for not only the
introduction but
all at his work over the years I have
been
a fan up marks since he was mayor
New Orleans he did great work there and
he's doing great work
at the National Urban League cell thank
you mark
and you know we're all thinking as I
hope we do every year about New Orleans
as we near the 10th anniversary of
Katrina something like that
should never be allowed it to happen in
the United States
America again so we have to keep
learning the lessons
and re pledging our commitment
I thank everyone for welcoming me here
today
I want to that give a shout out to your
national chairman of the board Michael
night or
also backstage I saw longtime friend
mind congressman Alcee Hastings
and Alexis Herman
who served in my husband's
administration and Tony West to served
in President Obama's administration
there's a
a veritable Hall of Fame here for this
event and I can never come to a National
Urban League
gathering without mentioning my lifelong
friend vernon jordan
he may not be here today but he's with
us in spirit because and his
deep love and commitment to this
organization
it's also close to my heart over the
years
I've gotten the chance to work with you
learn from you
I've poured over your state of black
America reports
I've spoken at your conferences but most
importantly
I've seen how you change people's lives
the theme at this conference
saving our cities education
jobs and justice speaks to the important
work that you've been doing for decades
I know that you help black entrepreneurs
get start-up capital
I know
you help people find jobs I know you
give families financial counseling so
they can achieve
their dreams a buying a home or sending
their kids to college
and you make sure parents have the tools
to take care
at their kids' health that's the kind
day-to-day commitment that makes such a
difference
as you help prepare young people for
college and work
in a world that can sometimes make them
feel that
they're not very important you make sure
they know just how precious and powerful
they really are this by to work
has been my work to my first job out of
law school wasn't at some big law firm
it was with the children's defense fund
started by
marion wright edelman that for summer
after I graduated I went door to door
for kids shut out of school and
denied the education they deserve I also
began a lifelong concern by working
with CDF to try to figure out what we
did with kids caught up in the juvenile
and adult
prison systems as first lady I helped
create the Children's Health Insurance
Program you were an ally
in doing that as senator I champion
small businesses owned by women and
people of color because
that's where a lot of the jobs in
america come from
I thought to raise the minimum wage
because no one who works hard in america
ship to raise their kids in poverty
these issues
your issues are deeply personal to me
so I'm here early on this morning first
and foremost to say thank you
but I'm also here to talk about the
future
because the work you have been doing
is more important than ever and I'm
going to keep
doing network right alongside you now I
would
love nothing more then to stay and have
a conversation
for hours going into depth about ever
single-issue that we are worried about
but you have a full slate of speakers
that will follow me
so let me make three points about the
work we need to do together
first the opportunity gap
that America is facing is not
just about economic in a quality it
is about racial in a quality now
that may seem obvious to you
but it bears underscoring because some
%uh
the evidence that backs it up would come
as a shock
too many Americans like how
african-americans are nearly three times
as likely as whites to be denied
a mortgage or how in 2013
the median well for white families was
more than one hundred and thirty-four
thousand dollars but for
african-american families
it was just eleven thousand dollars
a lot of people don't realize that our
schools are more segregated today than
they were in nineteen
68 or even
that african-americans are sentenced to
longer prison terms
than white people for the same crimes
or that political
operatives are trying every trick in the
book
to prevent african-americans from voting
and listen to this one
because as somebody who started with the
children's defense fund
and you now is the proud and delighted
grandmother a 10-month-old granddaughter
african-american children are
percent more likely to die
from asthma and white kids
now I studied
and advocated introduce legislation to
close
health disparities I knew I knew how
severe they were but five hundred
percent
so all this points to an on
avoidable conclusion race
race still plays a significant role
in determining who gets ahead in america
and who gets left behind
and yes wall that's partly a legacy of
discrimination that
stretches back to the start our nation
it is
also because it discrimination that is
still
on going I'm not saying anything
you don't already know you understand
this better than I do
better than anyone but i wanna say it
anyway
because I'm planning to be president and
anyone who seeks that office has a
responsibility to say it
and more than that
to grapple with the systemic inequities
that so many american space anyone who
asks for your boat
should tried their hardest to see things
as they actually
are not just as we want them to be so I
want you to know I see it and I could
hear you
and the racial disparities you work hard
every day to overcome goal against
everything I believe in and
everything I want to help america
achieve
the second point is this: this is not
just about statistics as damning as they
can be
this is about americans doing some
soul-searching
and holding ourselves to account this is
about all of us looking into
examining our assumptions and fears
and asking ourselves what more can
I do in my life to counter hate
and injustice how can I make
our country a better fairer
place let me be clear I think
all of us need to do that kinda
introspection but those of us who have
not experienced
systemic racial inequities
we have an extra obligation
we need to do a better job listening
when people talk about the scene
and unseen barriers they face every day
we need to practice humility
rather than assume that our experiences
are everyone's experiences and yes
we need to try as best we can to walk
in one another's shoes to imagine what
it would be
like to sit our son
down and have that talk or if people
followed us around stores
or locked their car doors when we walked
past
that empathy
that's what makes it possible for people
from
every background every race every
religion to come together as one nation
that's the kinda generosity of spirit
that makes a country like america endure
and given what we've seen
and experience over the last two years
this is an urgent call for people
to search their own hearts and mines
here's my third point
we've arrived at a moment when all these
challenges
are in sharp relief and we have to seize
it
too many times now americans have come
together
in shock and or to process
a violent senseless tragedy
like Trayvon Martin
shot to death not in some
empty desolate street somewhere but in a
gated community
wasn't stranger yet family there
worse and herbal and college
educated young woman who knew her rights
who didn't do anything wrong
but still ended up dying
in a jail cell together we've mourned
to mir rice sent Eric garner Walter
Scott
and Freddie gray and most recently
sham two bombs these names
are emblazoned on our hearts we've seen
their faces we've heard their grieving
families
we've seen a massacre in charleston
and black churches set on fire
two-day 20 50 but thankfully tragedy
is not all we have seen yes
the Confederate battle flag came down
finally
in South Carolina
families in the Charleston victims
reached out with
extraordinary grace to the man who
killed
their loved ones and President Obama
delivered a eulogy that sounded as
though it had come straight
from angels ending with amazing
race young people have taken to the
streets
dignified and determined urging us to
affirm
the basic fact that black
lives matter and because %uh people all
across this country sharing their
stories with courage
and strength a growing number of
Americans are realizing
but many are you have been
saying for a long time we can't go on
like this
we are better in this things
must change now it's up to us to build
on that momentum
and we all have to do our part but those
of us
we strive to lead have a special
responsibility
I'm very pleased that many presidential
candidates
will be here today to address you it is
a signal that the work you've been doing
laboring in the vineyards for decades
is getting the political attention it
deserves
but the real test have a candidate's
commitment
it's not whether we come to speak
at your national conference as important
as that is
it's whether we're still around after
the cameras are gone and the bolts are
pounded
it's whether
our positions live up to our rhetoric
and too often we see a mismatch between
what
some candidates say in venues like this
and what they actually do
when they're elected I don't think you
can credibly say that everyone has the
right to rise and then say you're for
phasing out medicare or for repealing
Obamacare
people can't rise if they can't afford
health care
they can't rise at the minimum wage is
too low to live on
they can't rise up there governor makes
it harder for them to get
a college education and you cannot
seriously talk about the right to rise
and support laws that deny the right
tugboat the
so yes what people say matters but what
they do matters more americans
especially today
deserved leaders who will face inequity
race and justice issues and all their
complexity
head-on who want just conceded that
there are barriers holding people back
who will do instead what it takes to
chair those barriers down
once and for all I will never stop
working
on issues have a quality and opportunity
race and justice that is a promise
I've done it my entire adult life
I will always be in your corner because
issues like these they are why
I'm running for president they are why I
got involved in public service
in the first place to tear down the
barriers that hold people back
from developing their talents and
achieving
their dreams I'm asking you
to hold me accountable to hold all of us
accountable
because the work that you're doing
must lead to action and you deserve
leaders who not only
get that but who will work hard every
day
to make our country a better place to
make it live
up to its potential and to provide the
opportunities for every single child in
this country
to live up to his or her
god-given potential yes I do have this
ten-month-old grandchild now
and I gotta tell you those have you
already have
reaches incredible transformational
point in your lives
understand this there is nothing
like it to focus you on the present you
know when bill and I
are with Charlotte doing our best to
babysit phones are off the TV is off
which is
focused on this miracle of life
and where the kinda grandparents I'll
confess that
you know when she learns to clap your
hands we give her a standing ovation
but you see it's not just
about our granddaughter isn't
we of course will do everything we can
to make sure she has
all the opportunities she should as
a citizen love this country as a child
God as a person who has the right
to go as far as her hard work and talent
will take ur
that's not enough I don't want that
just for my granddaughter I'm the
granddaughter of a factory worker
who work from the time he was a teenager
to the timely
retired in a Scranton Lee smells
I ate
Knoll how blessed I've been
and opportunities that I had that others
with
just as much talent did not sell let us
tear down the barriers
said no matter whose child you are or
grandchild you are
you too will have the same chance
I'm proud to be your ally I'm committed
to being
your partner I will keep fighting right
alongside you today and always to make
the United States of America a country
where
all men and women all boys and girls
are treated as they deserve to be as
equals I know we can do this
I know the path ahead is not easy
but i'm absolutely convinced that we
will
once again join hands
and make a difference for those young
people
will not only need a path but need the
love
and embrace have a grateful nation for
the contributions they each will make
to a better future for us all thank you
and god
bless you the
ladies and gentlemen I
Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton I've
got
job three short questions first we r
as a part of this process going to be I
sharing with you a questionnaire which
ask for your positions on issues
contained in the 21st century
I'll agenda for Jobs and Freedom
and I want to know if you can commit to
respond to that questionnaire we will
make it public
yes second
I like question is we have within the
urban league movement
an exciting generation up new
new generation leaders a who are coming
of age
could you talk to them a little bit
about
the role they would play they
you you plan for them to play both in
your campaign but also in the issues and
in your administration
some people refer to them as the
Millennials their part of our young
professionals
some heavy merges leaders of our
affiliates
but they are represented in large number
here could you talk to them for me
I'd be happy to mark and and let me just
make
a couple quick points because I think
this is by the most important questions
you or anybody could ask
on I have been so blessed over the years
to have had a lot have
wonderful people working for me I and
now I
have the next generation the Millennials
the the young activists who themselves
have been successful
and I see a difference between this
generation
and maybe some prior generations where
for african-americans for women for
others who
felt like they had to struggle to be
successful
there was a sense that thank goodness
I made it and I'm gonna do the best I
can in my life
I will make contributions but the days
of activism
are behind me this new generation
is in a very important way combining
personal success with continuing
act as a minivan and rotation and I
think we need that
I not only welcome it
I hope that we can together harness
it because like I said about my
granddaughter it is not enough that some
of us are successful
it is not enough when we see growing
inequality
economic and racial and social therefore
I in list and ask for the help
up this active committed young
generation
you know that's there's a great old
saying what you to do it what are you to
do
well you can comfort the afflicted
and afflict the comfortable that is part
of your role
and even though I sometimes may be on
the receiving end
that's okay because as I said in my
remarks I want you to hold me
accountable and I particularly want to
be held accountable
by young people who know the kinda
future they want to help us create
thank you very much in my up final
question
in the discussion around income
inequality the racial wealth gap
one part the conversation that's
been missing and not really address I is
the role of
small businesses african-american on
businesses
many of them face frozen credit markets
difficulty in building their business
what would you say to the archer print
yours about
how you would address those concerns
because
they are indeed job creators many of
them a women-owned businesses we serve
twelve thousand small businesses across
the nation
about seventy percent of them are women
own
and they are so crucial to closing
the racial wealth gap how would you
address
their concerns Omark we could be here
all day but let me quickly say
I wanna be the small business president
my dad was a small businessman
and I saw how hard he worked and how he
provided a good middle-class life
for my family and Marcus absolutely
right
on sixty percent have the
net jobs created in america are created
by small businesses but right now we
have
tax burdens regulatory burdens licensing
burdens
and credit barriers that are preventing
both the starting a small businesses and
their growth and expansion and it is
particularly a problem
for people of color and women and women
of color
especially sell part of what I wanna do
nm started to talk about this all across
the country
is to really 0n on tearing down those
barriers and one of the problems
as mark said is frozen credit lack of
credit
for 30-40 years I have worked on how you
get more credit
are too small businesses and
particularly underserved areas I helped
to start a development bank in arkansas
which is still operating and still
funding
a lot a small businesses somebody here
from arkansas thank you I want to take
that model across the country
I want to expand the small business
administration I want to make sure that
we have
online lending that is a specially
attuned to the needs a small business
so I have a hall a whole small business
agenda because
this is one of the keys to not only
creating well
and creating jobs but getting our
economy back
moving as quickly and fast as it can to
get back to where we were before the big
crash
now there's a lot more to talk about
just two quick points cuz I i'm
I don't wanna overstay my welcome but
two quick points in my economic plans
I talk about strong growth fair growth
and long-term growth
we cannot have any of that unless we do
more
to get more women into the workforce and
have them paid
fairly and take into account their
particular challenges
and secondly we have to get
of the load of student debt because that
is stopping a lot of young people
from starting best essay
says and so this it this is about the
whole economy but in particular what do
we need to do to clear the way
for small businesses to start and grow
and I'm gonna be
the small business president I Secretary
Hillary Rodham Clinton ladies in general
thank you for being a carefully
