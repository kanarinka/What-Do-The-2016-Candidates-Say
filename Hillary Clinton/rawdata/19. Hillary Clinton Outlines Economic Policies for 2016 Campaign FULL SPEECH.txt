the some hot thank you very much
president Van Zandt and thanks to
everyone add to the new school for
welcoming us today
I'm delighted to be back you know over
the past few months
I A and have the opportunity to listen
out to Americans concerns about an
economy that's still
isn't delivering for them it's not
delivering the way that it should
it still seems to most Americans I've
spoken with that it is stacked for those
at the top but I've also heard about
the hopes that people have for their
future going to college without drowning
in debt
starting that small business they've
always dreamed about
getting a job that pays well enough to
support a family
and provide for a secure retirement
previous generations of Americans built
the greatest economy
and strongest middle-class the world
has ever known on the promise
have a basic bargain if you work hard
and do your part you should be able to
get ahead
and when you get ahead America gets
ahead
but over the past several decades
that bargain has eroded our job
is to make it strong again for 35 years
Republicans have argued that if we give
Morwell to those at the top by cutting
their taxes
and letting big corporations right there
own rules
it will trickle down it will trickle
down to everyone outs
yet every time they have a chance to try
that
approach it explodes the national debt
concentrates well
even more and does practically nothing
to help hardworking Americans twice now
in the past 20 years a Democrat
president has had to calm in and clean
up the mass left behind the
I think the results speak for themselves
under president clinton I like the sound
of that
America saw the longest peacetime
expansion in our history nearly 23
million jobs
a balanced budget and a surplus for the
future
and most importantly incomes
rose across the board not just for those
already at the top eight years later
President Obama and the american
people's hard work
hold us back from the brink a depression
President Obama saved the auto industry
imposed new rules on wall street and
provided health care to 16
million Americans
now today today is the shadow of crisis
recedes
and longer-term challenges come into
focus
I believe we have to build a growth
and fairness economy you can't have one
without the other we can't create
enough jobs and new businesses without
more growth
and we can't build strong families
and support our consumer economy without
more fairness
we need both because while america is
standing again
we are not yet running the way we should
corporate profits
are at near record highs and Americans
are working as hard as ever but
paychecks
have barely budge in real terms
families today are stretched in so many
directions
and so are their budgets out-of-pocket
costs of health care
child-care caring for aging parents
are rising a lot faster than wages
I hear this everywhere I go
the single mom who talked to me about
juggling a job and classes at community
college
while raising three kids she doesn't
expect
anything to come easy but if she got a
raise
everything wouldn't be quite so hard the
grandmother who works
hound the clock providing child care to
other people's kids she's proud of her
work
but the pay is barely enough to live on
especially with the soaring price
up her prescription drugs the young
entrepreneur whose dream
buying the bowling alley where he worked
as a teenager was nearly derailed by his
student Dept
if you can grow his business he'll be
able to pay
of his dad and pay as employees
including himself
more too
millions of hard-working americans tell
similar stories
reaches need to rise to keep up
with costs paychecks need to grow
families who work hard and do their part
deserve to get ahead and stay ahead
the defining economic challenge
and our time is clear we must
raise incomes for hard-working Americans
so they can afford a middle-class life
we must drive strong and steady
income growth that lifts up families
and lifts up our country and that
and that will be my mission from that
first day
I'm president to the last I am
the
I will get up every day thinking about
the families have america like the
family that I came from
with a hard-working dad to start a small
business since cramped and saved in
gave us a good middle-class life I'll be
thinking about
all the people that I represented here
in New York in the stories that
they told me and that I worked with them
to improve
and I will as your president take on
this challenge
against the backdrop have major changes
in our economy
and the global economy that didn't start
with the recession
and won't and with the recovery you know
advances in technology and expanding
global trade have created
whole new areas of commercial activity
and open new markets for exports but too
often
they're also polarizing our economy
benefiting
high-skilled workers but displacing
board downgrading blue-collar jobs
and other mid-level jobs that used to
provide
solid incomes for millions Americans
today's marketplace focuses
too much on the short term like second
to second financial trading and
quarterly earnings reports and too
little
on long-term investments meanwhile
many Americans are making extra money
reading out a spare room designing web
sites
selling products they design themselves
at home or
even driving their own car this
on demand or so-called gigot economy
is creating exciting opportunities
and unleashing innovation but its
also raising hard questions about
workplace protections
and what a good job will look like in
the future
so I love these trends are real and
none none is going away but
they don't determine our destiny
the choices
we make as a nation matter and the
choices
we make in the years ahead will set the
stage
for what American life in the middle
class
in our economy will be like in this
century
as president I will work with every
possible partner to turn the tide
to make these currents have changed
start working for us
more than against us to strengthen
not Howell out the American middle class
because I think it our best that's what
Americans do
we are problem solvers not did nine
years
we don't hide from change we harness
said
the measure of our success must be
how much incomes rise for hard-working
families
not just for successful CEOs
and money managers and not just some
arbitrary
growth target untethered to people's
lives and livelihood
I wanna see our economy work for the
struggling
the striving and the successful
we're not gonna find all the answers we
need today in the PlayBook's in the past
we can't go back to the old policies
that
failed us before nor can we just replay
the successes today is not 1993
it's not 2009 so we need
solutions for the big challenges we face
now
today I'm proposing an agenda to raise
incomes for hard-working Americans
an agenda for strong growth share growth
and long-term growth let me begin with
strong growth
more growth means more jobs and more new
businesses
more jobs give people choices about
where to work
and employers have to offer higher
wages and better benefits in order to
compete
with each other to hire new workers and
keep
the productive ones that's why
economists how us that getting closer to
full
employment is crucial for raising
incomes
small businesses create more than 60
percent
have new American jobs on net so they
have to be a top priority
I've said I want to be the small
business president and I mean it
and throughout this campaign I'm going
to be talking about how we empower
entrepreneurs with less red tape easier
access to capital
tax relief and simplification how also
push for broader business tax reform
to spur investment in america closing
those loopholes that reward companies
for sending jobs and profits overseas
and I know stop always how we think
about this
but another engine have strong growth
should be comprehensive
immigration reform the
the
I want you to hear this bringing
millions of hardworking people
into the formal economy with increase
our gross domestic product buying
estimated
7 100 billion dollars over 10 years
then there are the new public
investments that will help establish
businesses
and entrepreneurs create the next
generation of high-paying jobs
you know when we get americans moving we
get our country moving
so let's establish an infrastructure
bank that can channel more public and
private fun
channel those funds to finance
world-class
airports railways roads bridges and
ports
the and let's build those faster
broadband
networks and make sure there's a greater
diversity
a provider's so consumers have more
choice
the and really
there's no excuse not to make greater
investment in cleaner renewable energy
right now our economy
obviously runs on energy and the time
has calmed to make America the world's
clean
energy superpower I advocate that
because these investments will create
millions jobs save us money in the long
run
and help us meet the threats up climate
change
and left fun the scientific
and medical research that spawns
innovative companies
and creates entire new industries
just as the project to sequence the
human genome did in the nineteen
nineties
and President Obama's initiatives on
pre- cision
medicine and brain research will do in
the coming years
I will set ambitious goals and all of
these areas
in the months ahead but today it let me
emphasize another key ingredient have
strong growth
that often goes overlooked and
undervalued breaking down barriers
sell more Americans participate more
fully
in the workforce a specially women
the
the
we hour in a global competition as I'm
sure you have noticed
and we can't afford to leave talent on
the sidelines
but that's exactly what we're doing
today when we leave people out
or write them off we not only short
change them
and their dreams we shortchange our
country
and our future the movement love women
into the american workforce over the
past 40 years
was responsible for more than
three-and-a-half
trillion dollars and economic growth but
that progress
has stalled the United States used to
rank seventh
outlive 24 advanced countries in women's
labor force participation
by 2013 we had dropped
to ninety that represents a lot I've
on used potential for our economy
and for american families studies show
that nearly
a third up this decline relative to
other countries is because their
expanding
family friendly policies like paid leave
and we are not we should be making it
easier for Americans to be both good
workers
and good parents and caregivers women
who want to work should be able to do so
without worrying
everyday about how they're going to take
care of their children
or what will happen if a family member
gets sick
you know last year
last year while I was at the hospital
here in Manhattan waiting for little
Charlotte to make a grand entrance
wanted the nurses said thank you for
fighting for paid leave
and we began to talk about it she sees
first-hand what it means
for herself and her colleagues
as well as for the working parents
that she helps a Cara it's time to
recognize that quality
affordable child care is not a luxury
its 8 growth strategy and it's way past
time to
and the outrage have so many women still
earning less than man on the job and
women up power
making even less the
you know all this lost money adds up
and for some women its thousands have
dollars
every year now I am well aware
that for far too long these challenges
have been dismissed
by some as women's issues while those
days
are over
fair pay and fair scheduling
paid family leave and earned sick days
child-care are Sentul to
our competitiveness and our growth and
we can do this
in a way that doesnt impose unfair
burdens on businesses especially small
businesses
as president our fight to put families
first
just like I have my entire career
now be on strong growth we also need
fair growth
and that will be the second key driver
have breezing
incomes the evidence is in
inequality is a drag on
our entire economy so this is the
problem
we need to tackle now you may have heard
governor bush say last week that
Americans just need to work
longer hours well he must not have met
very many American workers the
let him tell that to the nurse who
stands on her feet
all day or the teacher who is in that
classroom or the trucker who drives all
night
let him tell that to the fast-food
workers marching in the streets for
better pay
they don't need a lecture they need
a raise the
the
the truth there's the current rules for
our economy
to reward some work Mike financial
trading for example much more than other
work like actually
building and selling things the work
that is always ban
the backbone have our economy to get
all incomes rising again we need to
strike
a better balance if you work hard you
ought to be paid fairly
so we do have to raise the minimum wage
and implement President Obama's new
rules on overtime
and then we have to go further out
crackdown on bosses who exploit
employees by misclassifying them
as contractors or even steal their wages
to make
paycheck stretch we need to take on the
major
strains on family budgets out protect
the Affordable Care Act and build on it
to lower
out-of-pocket health care costs
and to make prescription drugs more
affordable
will help families look forward to
retirement by defending and enhancing
social security
and making it easier to save for the
future
now many of these proposals are
time-tested
and more been a little battle-scarred we
need
new ideas as well and one that I believe
in
and will fight for is profit-sharing
hard working americans deserve to
benefit
from the record corporate earnings they
help produce
so I will propose ways to encourage
companies
to share profits with their employees
that's good for workers
and good for businesses study show that
profit sharing that gives
everyone a stake in a company success
can boost productivity
and put money directly into employees
pockets
it's a win-win later this week in new
hampshire I'll have more to say about
how we do this another priority must be
reforming our tax code now we hear
republican candidates talk a lot
about tax reform but take
a good look at their plans senator
Rubio's
would cut taxes for households making
around
three million dollars a year by almost
two hundred and forty thousand dollars
which is way more than three times the
earnings
abate typical family well that's a sure
budget-busting giveaway to the super
wealthy and that's the kinda bad
economics
you're likely to hear from any at the
candidates
on the other side I have a different
take
guided by some simple principles
first hard-working families need
and deserve tax relief and
simplification
second those at the top have to pay
their fair share that's why I support
the Buffett Rule
which make sure that millionaires don't
pay
lower rates than their secretaries I've
also called for closing the carried
interest loophole
which lets wealthy financiers pay and
artificially lull rate and let's agree
that hugely successful companies that
benefit from
everything America has to offer should
not be able to game the system
and avoid paying their fair share
especially while companies who can't
afford
high-price lawyers and lobbyists end up
paying more
alongside tax reform it's time to stand
up to efforts across
our country to undermine worker
bargaining power which has been proven
again and again to drive up wages
republican governors like Scott Walker
have made their names
stomping on workers rights and
practically all the republican
candidates hope to do the same
as president I will fight back against
these mean-spirited
misguided attacks evidence the
evidence shows that the decline
unions may be responsible for a third
have the increase have in a quality
among men so if we want to get serious
about raising incomes we have to get
serious
about supporting union workers the
and let me just say a word here about
trade the Greek crisis
as well as the Chinese stock market have
reminded us that growth here at home
and growth and ocean away are linked in
a comment global
economy trade has been a major driver of
the economy
over recent decades but he has also
contributed to hollowing out
our manufacturing base and many
hard-working communities
so we do need to set a high bar for
trade agreements
we should support them if they create
jobs raise wages
in advance our national security and we
should be prepared
to walk away if they don't to create
share growth
we need to create opportunity
for more Americans I love
the saying by abraham Lincoln
who in many ways was not only
the president who saved our union
but the president who understood
profoundly the importance
up the middle class and the importance a
government
playing its role in providing
opportunities
he talked about giving Americans
a share chance in the race
life I believe that with all my heart
but I also believe it has to start
really early at birth high-quality
early learning especially in the first
five years
conceptual drawing on the course for
future success
and raise lifetime incomes by 25 percent
and
I'm committed to seeing
every four year old in america have
access to high-quality
preschool in the next 10 years but i
wanna do more
I want to call for a crate
outpouring have support from our faith
community our business community
are academic institutions from
philanthropy and civic groups and
concerned citizens to really help
parents particularly parents who are
facing a lot of obstacles
to really help prepare their own
children
in net 024 age group eighty percent
have your brain is physically formed by
the age of three
that's why families like mine
read talk and sing endlessly to our
granddaughter
I've said that her first words are gonna
be enough
with the reading and the copying singing
but we do it not only because we love
doing it
even though I'll admit it's a little
embarrassing you reading a book to a
two-week older a six-week-old
can recall but we do it because we
understand its
building her capacity for learning
and the research shows by the time she
enters kindergarten
she will have heard 30 million more
words than a child from unless
advantaged background think
I've what we are losing because we're
not doing
everything we can to reach out to those
families and we know
again from so much research here in the
United States and around the world
at that early help that mentoring that
intervention to help those often
stressed out young moms
understand more about what they can do
and to avoid
that difficulties that stand in the way
and they're being able
to really get their child off to the
best possible start
we also have to invest in our students
and our teachers at every level in the
coming weeks
and months I will lay out specific steps
to improve our schools
make college truly affordable and help
Americans
refinance their student debt and let's
embrace
let's embrace the idea lifelong learning
in a Jif technological change
we need to provide pathways to get
skills and credentials for new
occupations
and create online platforms to connect
workers to jobs there are exciting
efforts underway and I wanna support
and scale the ones that show results as
we pursue all these policies
we can't forget our fellow Americans hit
so hard and left behind by
this changing world from the inner
cities to call country
Indian country talent is universal
you find it everywhere but opportunity
is not there are nearly 6
million young people age
16 to 24 in america today
who are not in school or
at work the numbers for young people of
color
are particularly staggering a quarter a
young black man
and nearly fifteen percent Obama t know
youth
cannot find a job we've got to do a
better
way up coming up to match their growing
middle-class incomes we want to generate
with more pathways into the middle class
I firmly believe that the best
anti-poverty program is a job but that's
hard to say if there aren't enough jobs
for people that were trying to help
left themselves out of poverty that's
why I had called for reviving the new
markets tax credit
and empowerment zones to create greater
incentives to invest in poor
and remote areas when
when all americans have the chance to
study hard
work hard and share in our country's
prosperity
vats fair grow it's what I've always
believed in
and it's what I will fight for as
president now the third key driver
income alongside strong growth
and share growth must be long-term
growth too many pressures in our economy
push us toward short term -ism many
business leaders
see this they've talked to me about it
one is called it the problem
up quarterly capitalism they say
everything's focused and the next
earnings report for the short term share
price
and the result is too little attention
on the sources have long-term growth
research and development physical
capital and
talent net business investment which
includes things like factories machines
and research labs
had declined as a share the economy
in recent years some of our biggest
companies have spent more than half
their earnings to buy back their own
stock
and another third or more to pay
dividends
at doesn't leave a lot left
to raise pay or invest in the workers
who made those profits possible
or to make new investments necessary to
ensure
a company's future success these trends
need to change and I believe that many
business leaders
are eager to embrace their
responsibilities not just to today's
share price but also to workers
communities
and ultimately to our country and indeed
our planet
now I'm not talking about charity i'm
talking about. clear
I'd capitalism many companies have
prospered by improving wages
an training their workers that then
yields higher productivity
better service and larger profits
now it's easy to try to cut costs by
holding down
nor even decrease in pay and other
investments
to inflate quarterly stock prices but I
would argue that's bad for business
in the long run and it's really bad for
our country
workers are assets investing in them
pays off higher wages payoff
training pays off to help more companies
do that I proposed a new for fifteen
hundred dollar tax credit
for every worker they train and hire and
I will soon be proposing
a new plan to reform capital gains taxes
to reward longer-term investments that
create jobs
more than just quick trades
I will also propose reforms to help
CEO's
and shareholders alike focus on the next
decade rather than just
the next day making sure
stock buybacks aren't being used only
for an immediate boost
in share prices empowering outside
investors who want to build companies
but discouraging cut and Ron
shareholders who act more like
all school corporate Raiders and nowhere
will be shipped from short-term to
long-term
be more important that on wall street.
as a former senator from New York
I know firsthand the role that Wall
Street can
and should play in our economy helping
Main Street grow and prosper
and boosting new companies that make
America more competitive globally
but as we all know in the years before
the crash
financial firms piled risk up on risk
and regulators in washington either
couldn't
or wouldn't keep up I was alarmed by
this gathering storm and called for
addressing the risks derivatives
cracking down on subprime mortgages
and improving financial oversight under
President Obama's leadership
we've imposed tough new rules that deal
with some other challenges
on wall street but those rules have been
under assault by republicans in congress
and those running for president I will
fight
back against these attacks and protect
the reforms we've made
we can do that and still ease burdens
on community banks to encourage
responsible loans
to local people and businesses they know
and trust
we also have to go beyond dodd-frank
too many of our major financial
institutions
are still too complex and
too risky and the problems are not
limited
to the big banks to get all the
headlines serious risks are emerging
from
institutions and
so-called shadow banking system
including
hedge funds high-frequency traders
non-bank finance companies
so many new kinds up entities
which receive little oversight at all
stories have misconduct by individuals
and institutions
in the financial industry are shocking
HSBC allowing drug cartels to launder
money
five major banks pleading guilty to
felony charges
for conspiring to manipulate currency
exchange
and interest rates there can be no
justification
or tolerance for this kind a criminal
behavior
and while institutions had paid large
fines
and in some cases admitted guilt too
often
it has seemed that the human beings
responsible
get off with limited consequences
or none at all even when they've already
pocketed
the gains this is wrong and on my watch
it will change over the course
over the course of this campaign I will
offer plans to rein in
excessive risks on wall street and
ensure that stock markets work for
everyday investors
not just high-frequency traders and
those with the best
or fastest connections I will appoint
and empower regulators who understand
that too big to fail is still too big a
problem
will ensure will ensure that no firm
is too complex to manage or oversee
and we will prosecute individuals as
well as firms
when they commit fraud or other criminal
wrongdoing
and when the government recovers money
from corporations or individuals for
harming the public
it should go into a separate trust fund
to benefit the public
it could for example help modernize
infrastructure
or even be returned directly to
taxpayers
now reform is never easy
but we've done it be four in our country
and we have to get it right this time
and yes we need leadership
from the financial industry and across
the private sector
to join with us two years ago
the head of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange Terry Duffy
published an op-ed in the Wall Street
Journal
that really caught my attention he wrote
and I quote
i'm concerned. that does a bus
in financial services have forgotton who
we serve
and that the public knows it some wall
streeters can to
easily slip into regarding their work as
a kinda
money-making game divorced from the
concerns
I've Main Street and prompt I think we
should
listen to Terry Duffy of course
long-term growth is
only possible if the public sector steps
up as well
so it's time to and the era a budget
brinkmanship
and stop careening from one self
inflicted crisis to another it's time to
stop having debates over the small stuff
and focus how we're going to tackle the
big stuff together
how do we respond to technological
change in a way that creates more good
jobs
then it displaces or destroys can we
sustain
a boon in advanced manufacturing what
are the best ways to nurture startups
outside the successful corridors like
Silicon Valley
questions like these demands thoughtful
and mature debate
from our policymakers in government from
our leaders in the private sector
our economists are academics others who
can come together to the table
and on behalf America perform their
patriotic duty
to make sure our economy keeps working
and are middle-class keeps growing
the
so government has to be smarter simpler
more focused itself on long-term
investments than short term politics
and be a better partner to cities states
and the private sector
Washington has to be a better Stewart
Americans tax dollars and Americans
trust
and please let's get back to making
decisions
that rely on evidence more than ideology
the
that's what I'll do as president I will
seek out
and welcome any good idea that is
actually
based on reality I
wanna have principled and pragmatic and
progressive policies
that really move us forward together
and I will propose ways to ensure that
our fiscal
outlook is sustainable including by
continuing to restrain
health care costs which remain one of
the key drivers
have long-term deficits I will make sure
washington learns from how well local
governments businesses
and nonprofits are working together in
successful cities and towns
across america no passing legislation is
not the only way to drive progress
as president I will use the power to
convene
connect and collaborate to build
partnerships that actually get things
done
because above all we have to break out
of the poisonous
partisan gridlock and focus on the
long-term
needs our country
I i confess maybe it's the grandmother
in May but
I believe that part of public service
is planting trees under whose
shade you'll never see it and a vision
I've laid out here today for strong
growth share growth
and long-term growth all working
together
will get incomes rising again will help
working families
get ahead and stay ahead that is the
test
have our time and I'm inviting
everyone to please join me to do your
part
that's what great countries do that's
what
our country always has done we rise
to challenges it's not about left
right or center it's about the future
versus the past I'm running for
president to build an america
for tomorrow not yesterday an America
built on
growth and fairness an America where if
you do your part you will reap the
rewards
where we don't leave any why
the
the
the
the
thank you all the
I just want to leave you with one more
thought I want every child
not just the grand daughter of a former
president
or former Secretary of State but every
child
or her god-given potential please join
me
in that mission let's do it together
thank you
%uh the
driving the new markets tax credit and
empowerment zones
to create greater incentives to invest
in poor
and remote areas when
when all americans have the chance to
study hard
work hard and share in our country's
prosperity
vats fair grow it's what I've always
believed in
and it's what I will fight for as
president now the third key driver
income alongside strong growth
and share growth must be long-term
growth too many pressures in our economy
push us toward short term is some many
business leaders
see this they've talked to me about it
one is called it the problem
up quarterly capitalism they say
everything's focused and the next
earnings report for the short term share
price
and the result is too little attention
on the sources have long-term growth
research and development physical
capital and
talent net business investment which
includes things like
factories machines and research labs had
declined
as a share the economy in recent years
some of our biggest companies have spent
more than half
their earnings to buy back their own
stock
and another third or more to pay
dividends
at doesn't leave a lot left
to raise pay or invest in the workers
who made those profits possible
or to make new investments necessary to
ensure
a company's future success these trends
need to change and I believe that many
business leaders
are eager to embrace their
responsibilities not just two days
share price but also to workers
communities
and ultimately to our country and indeed
our planet
now I'm not talking about charity i'm
talking about. clear
I'd capitalism many companies have
prospered by improving wages
an training their workers that then
yields higher productivity
better service and larger profits
now it's easy to try to cut costs by
holding down or even decrease in pay
and other investments to inflate
quarterly stock prices
but I would argue that's bad for
business in the long run
and it's really bad for our country
workers are
assets investing in them pays off
higher wages payoff training
pays off to help more companies do that
I proposed a new for fifteen hundred
dollar tax credit
for every worker they train and hire and
I will soon be proposing
a new plan to reform capital gains taxes
to reward longer-term investments that
create jobs
more than just quick trades the
I will also propose reforms to help
CEO's
and shareholders alike focus on the next
decade rather than just
the next day making sure
stock buybacks aren't being used only
for an immediate boost
in share prices empowering outside
investors who want to build companies

the some hot
thank you very much president Van Zandt
and thanks to everyone
add to the new school for welcoming us
today
I'm delighted to be back you know over
the past few months
I am. have the opportunity to listen
out to Americans concerns about an
economy that's still
isn't delivering for them it's not
delivering the way that it should
it still seems to most Americans I've
spoken with
that it is stacked for those at the top
but I've also heard
about the hopes that people have for
their future
going to college without drowning in
debt starting that small business
they've
always dreamed about getting a job that
pays well enough to support a family
and provide for a secure retirement
previous generations of Americans built
the greatest economy
and strongest middle-class the world
has ever known on the promise
have a basic bargain if you work hard
and do your part you should be able to
get ahead
and when you get ahead America gets
ahead
but over the past several decades
that bargain has eroded our job
is to make it strong again for 35 years
Republicans have argued that if we give
Morwell to those at the top by cutting
their taxes
and letting big corporations right there
own rules
it will trickle down it will trickle
down to everyone else
yet every time they have a chance to try
that
approach it explodes the national debt
concentrates well even more
and does practically nothing to help
hardworking Americans twice now
in the past 20 years a democratic
president has had to calm
in and clean up the mass
left behind the
I think the results speak for themselves
under president clinton I like the sound
of that
America saw the longest peacetime
expansion in our history nearly 23
million jobs
a balanced budget and a surplus for the
future
and most importantly incomes
rose across the board not just for those
already at the top eight years later
President Obama and the american
people's hard work
hold us back from the brink have
depression
President Obama saved the auto industry
imposed new rules on wall street and
provided health care to 16
million Americans
now today today as the shadow of crisis
recedes
and longer-term challenges come into
focus
I believe we have to build a growth
and fairness economy you can't have one
without the other we can't create
enough jobs and new businesses without
more growth
and we can't build strong families
and support our consumer economy without
more fairness
we need both because while america is
standing again
we are not yet running the way we should
corporate profits
are at near record highs and Americans
are working as hard as ever but
paychecks
have barely budged in real terms
families today are stretched in so many
directions
and so are their budgets out-of-pocket
costs of health care
child-care caring for aging parents
are rising a lot faster than wages
I hear this everywhere I go
the single mom who talked to me about
juggling a job and classes at community
college
while raising three kids she doesn't
expect
anything to come easy but if she got a
raise
everything wouldn't be quite so hard the
grandmother who works
hound the clock providing child care to
other people's kids she's proud ever
work
but the pay is barely enough to live on
especially with the soaring price
up her prescription drugs the young
entrepreneur whose dream
buying the bowling alley where he worked
as a teenager was nearly derailed by his
student Dept
if he can grow his business he'll be
able to pay
of his dad and pay as employees
including himself
more too
millions of hard-working americans tell
similar stories
reaches need to rise to keep up
with costs paychecks need to grow
families who work hard and do their part
deserve to get ahead and stay ahead
the defining economic challenge
and our time is clear we must
raise incomes for hard-working Americans
so they can afford a middle-class life
we must drive strong and steady
income growth that lifts up families
and lifts up our country and that
and that will be my mission from that
first day
I'm president to the last I am
the I will get up
every day thinking about the families
have america like the family that I came
from
with a hard-working dad to start a small
business since cramped and saved in
gave us a good middle-class life I'll be
thinking about
all the people that I represented here
in New York in the stories that
they told me and that I worked with them
to improve
and I will as your president take on
this challenge
against the backdrop have major changes
in our economy
and the global economy that didn't start
with the recession
and won't and with the recovery you know
advances in technology and expanding
global trade have created
whole new areas of commercial activity
and open new markets for exports but too
often
they're also polarizing our economy
benefiting
high-skilled workers but displacing
word downgrading blue-collar jobs
into the american workforce over the
past 40 years
was responsible for more than
three-and-a-half
trillion dollars and economic growth but
that progress
has stalled the United States used to
rank seventh
outlive 24 advanced countries in women's
labor force participation
by 2013 we had dropped to ninety
that represents a lot I've on
used potential for our economy and for
american families
studies show that nearly a third
up this decline relative to other
countries
is because their expanding family
friendly policies like paid leave and we
are not
we should be making it easier for
Americans to be both good workers
and good parents and caregivers
women who want to work should be able to
do so without worrying
everyday about how they're going to take
care of their children
or what will happen if a family member
gets sick
you know last year
last year while I was at the hospital
here in Manhattan waiting for little
Charlotte to make a grand entrance
wanted the nurses said thank you for
fighting for paid leave
and we began to talk about it she sees
first-hand what it means
for herself and her colleagues
as well as for the working parents
that she helps take care of it's time to
recognize that quality
affordable child care is not a luxury
its 8 growth strategy and it's way past
time to
and the outrage have so many women still
earning less than man on the job and
women up power
making even less the
you know all this lost money adds up
and for some women its thousands have
dollars
every year now I am well aware
that for far too long these challenges
have been dismissed
by some as women's issues while those
days
are over the fair pay
and fair scheduling paid family leave
and earned sick days child-care
are Sentul to our competitiveness
and our growth and we can do this
in a way that doesnt impose unfair
burdens on businesses especially small
businesses
as president our fight to put families
first
just like I have my entire career
now be on strong growth we also need
fair growth
and that will be the second key driver
have breezing
incomes the evidence is in
inequality is a drag on
our entire economy so this is the
problem
we need to tackle now you may have heard
governor bush say last week that
Americans just need to work
longer hours well he must not have met
very many American workers the
let him tell that to the nurse who
stands on her feet
all day or the teacher who is in that
classroom or the trucker who drives
all night let him tell that to the
fast-food workers marching in the
streets for better pay
they don't need a lecture they need
a raise the
the
the truth says the current rules for our
economy
to reward some work Mike financial
trading for example much more than other
word like actually
building and selling things the work
that is always ban
the backbone have our economy to get
all incomes rising again we need to
strike
a better balance if you work hard you
ought to be paid fairly
so we do have to raise the minimum wage
and implement President Obama's new
rules on overtime
and then we have to go further out
crackdown on bosses who exploit
employees by misclassifying them
as contractors or even steal their wages
to make paycheck stretch
we need to take on the major strange on
family budgets
out protect the Affordable Care Act and
build on it to lower
out-of-pocket health care costs
and to make prescription drugs more
affordable
will help families look forward to
retirement by defending and enhancing
social security
and making it easier to save for the
future
now many of these proposals are
time-tested
and more been a little battle-scarred we
need
new ideas as well and one that I believe
in
and will fight for is profit-sharing
hard working americans deserve to
benefit
from the record corporate earnings they
help produce
so I will propose ways to encourage
companies
to share profits with their employees
that's good for workers
and good for businesses study show that
profit sharing that gives
everyone a stake in a company success
can boost productivity
and put money directly into employees
pockets
it's a win-win later this week in new
hampshire I'll have more to say about
how
we do this another priority must be
reforming our tax code now we hear
republican candidates talk a lot
about tax reform but take
a good look at their plans senator
Rubio's
would cut taxes for households making
around
three million dollars a year by almost
two hundred and forty thousand dollars
which is way more than three times the
earnings
have a typical family well that's a sure
budget-busting giveaway to the super
wealthy and that's the kinda bad
economics
you're likely to hear from any at the
candidates
on the other side I have a different
take
guided by some simple principles
first hard-working family and other
mid-level jobs that used to provide
solid incomes
for millions Americans today's
marketplace
focuses too much on the short term like
second to second financial trading and
quarterly earnings reports and too
little
on long-term investments meanwhile
many Americans are making extra money
reading out a spare room designing web
sites
selling products they design themselves
at home or
even driving their own car this
on demand or so-called gigot economy
is creating exciting opportunities
and unleashing innovation but its
also raising hard questions about
workplace protections
and what a good job will look like in
the future
so I love these trends are real and
none none is going away but
they don't determine our destiny
the choices remake
as a nation matter and the choices
we made in the years ahead will set the
stage
for what American life in the middle
class
in our economy will be like in this
century
as president I will work with every
possible partner to turn the tide
to make these currents have changed
start working for us
more than against us to strengthen
not Howell out the American middle class
because I think it our best that's what
Americans do
we are problem solvers not did nine
years
we don't hide from change we harness
said
the measure of our success must be
how much incomes rise for hard-working
families
not just for successful CEOs
and money managers and not just some
arbitrary
growth target untethered to people's
lives and livelihood
I wanna see our economy
work for the struggling the striving
and the successful we're not gonna find
all the answers we need today in the
PlayBook's in the past we can't go back
to the old policies that
failed us before nor can we just replay
the successes today is not 1993
it's not 2009 so we need
solutions for the big challenges we face
now
today I'm proposing an agenda to raise
incomes for hard-working Americans
an agenda for strong growth share growth
and long-term growth let me begin with
strong growth
more growth means more jobs and more new
businesses
more jobs give people choices about
where to work
and employers have to offer higher
wages and better benefits in order to
compete
with each other to hire new workers and
keep
the productive ones that's why
economists how us that getting closer to
full
employment is crucial for raising
incomes
small businesses create more than 60
percent
have new American jobs on net so they
have to be a top priority
I've said I want to be the small
business president
and I mean it and throughout this
campaign I'm going to be talking about
how we empower
entrepreneurs with less red tape easier
access to capital
tax relief and simplification how also
push for broader business tax reform
to spur investment in america closing
those loopholes that reward companies
for sending jobs and profits overseas
and I know its top always how we think
about this
but another engine out strong growth
should be comprehensive
immigration reform the
the
I want you to hear this bringing
millions of hardworking people
into the formal economy with increase
our gross domestic product buying
estimated
7 100 billion dollars over 10 years
then there are the new public
investments that will help establish
businesses
and entrepreneurs create the next
generation of high-paying jobs
you know when we get americans moving we
get our country moving
so let's establish an infrastructure
bank that can channel more public and
private fun
channel those funds to finance
world-class
airports railways roads bridges and
ports
the and let's build those faster
broadband
networks and make sure there's a greater
diversity
a provider's so consumers have more
choice
the and really
there's no excuse not to make greater
investment in cleaner renewable energy
right now
our economy obviously runs on energy and
the time
has calmed to make America the world's
clean energy
superpower I advocate that because these
investments will create
millions jobs save us money in the long
run
and help us meet the threats up climate
change
and let's fun the scientific
and medical research that's ponds
innovative companies
and creates entire new industries
just as the project to sequence the
human genome
did in the nineteen nineties and
President Obama's initiatives
on pre- cision medicine and brain
research will do
in the coming years I will set ambitious
goals
and all of these areas in the months
ahead but today let me emphasize another
key ingredient
have strong growth that often goes
overlooked
and undervalued breaking down barriers
sell more Americans participate more
fully
in the workforce a specially women
the
we hour in a global competition as I'm
sure you have noticed
add we can't afford to leave talent on
the sidelines
but that's exactly what we're doing
today when we leave people out
or write them off we not only short
change them
and their dreams we shortchange our
country
and our future the movement love women
days need and deserve tax relief
and simplification second those at the
top
have to pay their fair share that's why
I support
the Buffett Rule which make sure that
millionaires don't pay
lower rates than their secretaries I've
also called for closing the carried
interest loophole
which lets wealthy financiers pay and
artificially
lull rate and let's agree that's hugely
successful companies
that benefit from everything America has
to offer
should not be able to game the system
and avoid paying their fair share
especially while companies who can't
afford
high-priced lawyers and lobbyists end up
paying more
alongside tax reform it's time to stand
up to efforts across
our country to undermine worker
bargaining power which has been proven
again and again to drive up wages
republican governors like Scott Walker
have made their names
stomping on workers rights and
practically all the republican
candidates help to do the same
as president I will fight back against
these mean-spirited
misguided attacks evidence the
evidence shows that the decline
unions may be responsible for a third
have the increase have in a quality
among men so if we want to get serious
about raising incomes we have to get
serious
about supporting union workers the
and let me just say a word here about
trade the Greek crisis
as well as the Chinese stock market have
reminded us that growth here at home
and growth and ocean away are linked in
a comment global
economy trade has been a major driver of
the economy
over recent decades but he has also
contributed to hollowing out
our manufacturing base and many
hard-working communities
so we do need to set a high bar for
trade agreements
we should support them if they create
jobs
raise wages in advance our national
security
and we should be prepared to walk away
if they don't to create share growth
we need to create opportunity
for more Americans I love
the saying by abraham Lincoln
who in many ways was not only
the president who saved our union
but the president who understood
profoundly the importance
up the middle class and the importance a
government
playing its role in providing
opportunities
he talked about giving Americans
a share chance in the race
life I believe that with all my heart
but I also believe it has to start
really early at birth high-quality
early learning especially in the first
five years
can set children on the course for
future success
and raise lifetime incomes by 25 percent
and
I'm committed to seeing
every four year old in america have
access to high-quality
preschool in the next 10 years but i
wanna do more
I want to call for a crate
outpouring have support from our faith
community our business community
are academic institutions from
philanthropy and civic groups and
concerned citizens to really help
parents particularly parents who are
facing a lot of
obstacles to really help prepare their
own
children in net 024 age group
eighty percent have your brain is
physically formed by the age of three
that's why families like mine
read talkin saying endlessly to our
granddaughter
I've said that her first words are gonna
be enough
with the reading and the cocking singing
but we do it not only because we love
doing it
even though I'll admit it's a little
embarrassing you're reading a book to a
two-week older a six-week-old
can recall but we do it because we
understand
its building her capacity for learning
and the research shows by the time she
enters kindergarten
she will have heard 30 million more
words than a child from unless
advantaged background think
I've what we are losing because we're
not doing
everything we can to reach out to those
families and we know
again from so much research here in the
United States
and around the world at that early help
that mentoring that intervention to help
those
often stressed out young moms understand
more about what they can do and to avoid
that difficulties that stand in the way
and they're being able
to really get their child off to the
best possible start
we also have to invest in our students
and our teachers at every level in the
coming weeks
and months I will lay out specific steps
to improve our schools
make college truly affordable and help
Americans
refinance their student debt and let's
embrace
let's embrace the idea lifelong learning
in a Jif technological change we need to
provide pathways
to get skills and credentials for new
occupations
and create online platforms to connect
workers to jobs there are exciting
efforts underway and I wanna support
and scale the ones that show results as
we pursue all these policies
we can't forget our fellow Americans hit
so hard and left behind by
this changing world from the inner
cities to call country
Indian country talent is universal
you find it everywhere but opportunity
is not there are nearly 6
million young people age
16 to 24 in america today
who are not in school or
at work the numbers for young people of
color
are particularly staggering a quarter a
young black man
and nearly fifteen percent of all latino
youth
cannot find a job we've got to do a
better
way up coming up to match their growing
middle-class incomes we want to generate
with more pathways into the middle class
I firmly believe that the best
anti-poverty program is a job but that's
hard to say if there aren't enough jobs
for people that were trying to help
left themselves out of poverty that's
why I had called for review
