good afternoon my husband Jackson and I
raising
three boys Michael 16 William
14 Jack 10 since they were very little
we taught them to be advocates for
themselves those
issues they believe in and those that
may be on the fringe
society not in other words we're raising
boys
who we hope will be fighters for those
things
and people they believe in that is
exactly
the kinda person who belongs in the
white house the
Jackson and I want to have a president
for our boy
your children your grandchildren
and knows that do not have a voice to
ensure
right and vibrant future who will fight
to create an economy for tomorrow
who will fight to make our families and
communities stronger
who will fight to make sure each our
nation is secure
from the growing threat terrorism who
will fight for campaign finance reform
so that our government is on by it the
and not my handful
the wealthiest in this country the
and selfishly as I
when who will fight to help us rebuild
our party
here in Iowa so are state can once again
offering
leaders like Tom Vilsack and Tom Harkin
the
go Hillary you have proven yourself
to be that fighter
I know you will fight my voice and all
my 96-year-old
Nana Kennedy passed away five years ago
she had hoped she would live long enough
to see a woman president
she believed that present that woman
would be you and she had the best
political instincts anyone I know she
was right
it is going to be you the
and because bad it is my deep honor
introduce to you the next president
the United States the
care thank you for that introduction
thank you for being committed
to the right values fighting for them
in the political arena in your home
across this state and country I have to
tell you I am thrilled to be here to see
olive you it is a special treat to be
here
not only that day after I kicked off the
form a part of my camp
but to be here on flag day
because after all
we care deeply about the country we love
and we cherish
and political campaigns should be about
what kind of future
we can create together for
ourselves most particularly our children
and our grandchildren
now over the past month I've been
listening
to what you here and I'll have to say
Inc and coffee shops in community
colleges
in businesses I've heard you share
worries about the economy
still seems stack those top
but I've also heard about your hopes
for your family's and our country
I met a single mom juggling a job in
classes at community college while
raising three kids
she doesn't expect anything to come
easy but she did ask me what more can be
done
so it isn't quite so hard for families
like hers
I believe the answer lies in the basic
bargain
America if you do your part you ought to
be able to get ahead
and when everybody does their part
America
gets ahead
bargain inspired generations families
including
my own it's what kept my grandfather
going to work
as a factory worker in the same lace
mill in Scranton Pennsylvania
every day for fifty years it's what led
my father to believe that if
scram and say he could start a small
business
bringing drapery fabric in Chicago
and could provide us with the middle
class life
and he did and as much as our world has
changed
the structure of our economy and the
shape our families and so much more
bad basic bargain still holds the key
to our prosperity here in Iowa and
across the country
americans are working themselves back
from economic crisis that exploded
because time-tested values
were replaced by false promises you know
what they were
instead a min economy bill by every
American
for every american we were told that
if we let those at the top pay lower
taxes
and band the rules their success
with trickle-down to everyone else
and we know how that worked out so
americans have made a new beginning
working extra shifts taking second jobs
postponing home repairs families figured
out how they could
make it work again and now people here
across Iowa
are thinking about the future okay
going to college starting at business
you've always dreamed about buying a
house
finally be able to put more away for
retirement
so we're standing again but we're not
yet running
I said in my speech yesterday that
both the two democratic presidents the
last 35 years
one Iraq Obama the other
my husband the
show that it is possible to do better
they both inherited the problems from
their republican predecessors
and they had day guess out of holes
but the facts speak for themselves
producing more jobs for more people
creating more economic opportunity and
prosperity
and trying to build a strong foundation
for what we do
next but you know what you see you see
corporations
making record profits with CEOs making
record pay
your paycheck have barely budged while
many have you
are working multiple jobs to make ends
me
you see the top 25 hedge
bond managers making more
then all the kindergarten teachers
in america come by
and often paying a lower tax rate
than those kindergarten teachers so you
have to wonder when does my
hard work pay off when does my family
get ahead when
I say now
prosperity just be
for CEOs and hedge fund managers
democracy
can't just be four billionaires and
corporations
prosperity and democracy our part your
basic bargain to
you brought our country back
now it's time it
your time to secure the gains and move
ahead
and you know what America
can succeed unless you 60
people ball races in
educational levels every kind of America
you can imagine
stand and pledge allegiance to the swag
they sing the national anthem at
sporting events
school assemblies its time
everybody felt like they were included
and that they had the same
shank
live up to their own potential I'm
running for president to make our
economy
work for you and for every american the
I'm not running for some Americans but
for all americans and we have come too
far to see our progress
ripped away now we can't go back to the
top down
economic policies that failed us before
you know that old saying for me one
shame on you will meet twice
shame on me now there may be some new
voices in the republican presidential
wire but they're all singing the same
all
song it's a song called yesterday
now I know when I said this yesterday
you know the song all our troubles look
as though they're here to stay
and we need a place to hide away
they believe yesterday and your
lucky I didn't try to sing
you know but when they heard me and
budget jumped up yesterday over
well then and policies that yesterday
Rep
trip for themselves promising lower
taxes for the wealthy
and fewer rules for the biggest
corporations without regard for how that
would make
income inequality worse now ask these
candidates about climate change
one of the defining threat our time
and they'll say I'm not a scientist well
then why don't they start
listening to those who are
edge wide top
rules on wall street. rather than
reining in the banks that are still
to risky courting future failures
what they have a case math amnesia
that was tried we saw what happened
they want to take away health insurance
from sixteen
million Americans without offering any
credible alternative
shame and blame women rather than
respect
our right to make our the
the
yea wanna put immigrants to work hard
and pay taxes at risk deport deportation
and they turned their backs i'm gay
people who love each other
the
finally fundamentally favorite Jack
what it takes to build an inclusive
economy it takes an inclusive society
a village with a place for everyone
my values and a lifetime
experiences have given me a different
vision for america
I believe our success is it measured
by how much the wealthiest americans
have by
how many children climb poverty
how many startups and small businesses
open and thrive
how many young people go to college
without drowning
in dat the
how many people find a good job in
how many families get ahead and stay
that's why
you here give me the chance
I will wage in four fights for you
the first to make the economy work for
everyday Americans
not just those at the time in the coming
weeks
out propose specific policies
to reward businesses to invest long-term
value rather than a quick buck because
that leads to higher
growth for the economy higher wages for
workers
and yes even bigger profit I will
rewrite the tax code
rewards hard work and investment here
home not quick trades
for stashing profits oversee
I'm new incentives to companies that
give
their employees air share
up profits that their heart
I will work to on leash a new generation
entrepreneurs and small business owners
by providing
tax relief cutting red tape and making
it easier to get a small business loan
there was one of the stories I heard
across people who wanted to start a
small business
struggling to make it grow were saying i
cant access to credit well the big guys
can
it's time you did too
I will restore America cutting-edge
innovation science and research you know
we are on the brink
so many breakthroughs about disease it
breaks my heart
that because the congress has cut back
on our funding for finding out what to
do about alzheimer's
or autism so many other labs have been
forced to close
young scientists told I'm sorry just not
important enough
for us to continue funding you right now
this is such a short term view
how we can do better I will get those
science labs open I will get those
scientists back to work
together
we can make america into the clean
energy
superpower in the world
you're already showing the way
Aaron with and an advanced biofuels
we just need to organize our economy so
that it in bass in the renewable a bio
fuels the solar the win
on a national scale and you know what
there are millions
%uh jobs waiting for us if we don't
create
here at home I can guarantee you that
Chinese the germans and others will
create them over there
let's not hip hop until we have the
cleanest
most prosperous energy economy in the
world
as I roll out these policies I want you
to understand where I'm coming from
I'm gonna propose an infrastructure bank
funded with bonds we need better roads
we need better
or port airport we need better bridges
we need better broadband we need all of
that
and it's a shame that were allowing our
infrastructure to crumble before our
eyes
and its send a message that we don't
want to send that we're not going to be
competitive in the future
but it's also important to remember
what's your biggest asset
our people and particularly
our youngest I wanna make
preschool and quality child care
available to
every child
I wanna make sure we give our teachers
respect they deserve sparking
burning every child I'll be giving you
specifics about how I
intend to make college affordable and to
live that crushing burden
obscured
and how we will finally make
lifelong learning available for
everybody
to gain or improve the skills they need
and to set up
more Americans for success I wanna say a
word about
another issue there's a lot of
discussion right now
about the potential trans-pacific
partnership trade deal
I wanna tell you what I think needs to
be in that agreement
first let me start by saying no
president
would be a tougher negotiator
on behalf of american workers either
with our trading partners
or Republicans on Capitol Hill then I
would be
my time eight years in the senate I
voted for some trade agreement
and I voted against others I think I
have a pretty good idea
what we can do to meet task I believe
any trade agreement especially TPP must
meet
it he said number one protect american
workers
number two it needs to raise wages and
create the jobs at home
number three it needs to be in our
national security interest
I've been saying that for months here's
what I think should happen
now in order to get
a deal that meets these high standards
the president should listen to
and work with his allies in congress
starting
with Nancy Pelosi who have expressed
their concerns
about the impact that a weak agreement
would have on our workers
to make sure we get the best
strongest deal possible and if we don't
get there should be no
deal
now in fact
I think this is the opportunity to speak
out
you know they're the voices you heard
them therefore the deal no matter what's
in it
and their the voices that are against
the deal no matter what's in it
I kinda fall in the group that says
let's find out what's in it and let's
make it
as good as it can be and then let's make
a decision and
from my perspective the president
actually has
this amazing opportunity now you know
how to negotiate
so you go to the trading partners the
people that have been involved in this
negotiation
go I miss you give me more I miss you
meet the needs
that have been laid out that my party in
congress
had on and spoken out about
and made clear have to be in the deal
we're not gonna have a deal
but we could have a deal if we made sure
that we did everything possible to
protect american workers
to rage the wages of american workers to
make sure that
is in our national security interest and
there are some specifics in there
that could and should be changed so I am
hoping
thats what happens now let's take
the women's internet and eliminate
let's say if there is a way to get to an
agreement.
that does do what II expected to do
it has to include Trade Adjustment
authority
to provide kinda protections for
American workers
that I am looking for but I am
willing to try now to see whether
you can't push to get rid of the
objectionable parts
to drive a harder bargain on sum up the
other parts and to provide more
transparency so that the american people
can actually see what will be n a
proposed final deal
and so
if I were in the white house that would
that's what I'd be doing right now I
would be trying to figure out
whether there is a way to get a deal
that does what it should do the american
workers that people
starting with leader Pelosi can say you
know what we've made some real changes
here
this might work or not but let's try and
see
whether they're is this opportunity now
we also
have to recognize that if we don't do
more to help american families we can
have agreements from here
to the moon and we're still not gonna
make it possible for most american
families
feel like they're getting ahead and from
my perspective
I believe you should have the right turn
paid sick days
you should have the right to receive
your work schedule with enough notice
arrange childcare you should be able to
look forward retirement with confidence
and you should certainly be able to
count on your health care being there
without breaking the bank
and way past time to and the outrageous
so many women still
earning less than men jogged
this is in a woman's issue this is a
family issue
every American family should feel like
they belong
and I will do everything to make sure
that happens
and here at home we do
we do have to be aware that you know
there are threats in the world I think
they're far more opportunities
let's admit there are threats our brave
men and women come home from war
finish their service I will do
everything I can to see that they get
not just our thanks but the care and
benefits they've earned
when I was in the senate when I was in
the senate I talked to
my constituents in New York first things
I heard
our national guard troops didn't get
access to the same health care benefits
but they were being called more and more
so I worked across the aisle to make
sure they did
and I have a lot respect for what are
service members an arbiter have done for
us
and it's not enough just to give a
speech we gotta do much more
I've also stood up to adversaries like
you attack me publicly
forward standing up to him which I took
badge of honor
the
and I know we have to work more closely
with our allies and partners around the
world to build trying to save secure
prosperous world i'm looking for that
means
our nato partners in Europe means our
treaty allies in Asia it means our
friends
right here in Latin America it means
Israel and the Middle East we have to
work more closely
to make sure that they and we are on the
same page
United States can't do this alone we
shouldn't do it alone
we have to lead the world because the
alternative us leading the world
is a vacuum there will be filled by some
pretty dangerous characters
so we do have to leave the world but we
need to lead
by pulling everybody together being in
the same
and finally the fourth fight under
girds so much what I want to achieve in
the other three an
is in order to be strong in the world we
have to be strong
home that's why we have to reform our
government
and revitalize our democracy works for
everybody
stop endless secret unaccountable
money that is distorting our elections
corrupting our political process
running out
hi I would appoint justices to the
Supreme Court
who would protect every citizen's right
to both rather than every corporation
right
if necessary
I will support a constitutional
amendment to
undo the supreme court's decision in the
Citizens United
but not not at this will work unless
people like you and millions and
millions more across our country turn
out and vote
I wanna make easier for every citizen to
about
we need universal automatic registration
win a young American turns a team so
that they are signed up
I gave a speech already giving notice to
the republicans I will
fight them on their efforts to
disempowered
and disenfranchised young people poor
people
people with disabilities and people of
color no matter what state they're and
the
what heart democracy are they afraid up
it's time to hold them
accountable now we americans may differ
and bicker and stumble and fall that's
kind of been our DNA
but we are at our best when we pick each
other up when we have each other's back
and like any family our American family
is strongest when we
shares we have in common and fight back
against those who would drive us
apart
from my first trip as Secretary of State
to Asia in February 2009
to my very last people all over the
world
ask me you and present
work together after you fought so hard
against each other in that campaign it
was understandable question considering
that in many places if you lose an
election you could be exiled in prison
or even killed
not hired a secretary stay and the first
time I was asked this
I was on a TV show the morning
TV show in Jakarta Indonesia and I got
asked the question
unlike any TV show ever been on before
since
dancing and singing I was worried there
and asked me to sing my favorite songs
which
you know I do love to sing but nobody
left well ten stop
then all of a sudden I get asked this
question and you know the TV cameras are
going
going right now I have like a nanosecond
or what I'm gonna say
question no
really important question because it's a
new democracy
in many places in the world people
put their family their clan try their
race their sec
for their country and so I was being
how you do it in america and I said
you're right really hard campaign
against each other he won I lost
when he asked me to Sir I accepted
for the same reason we both love our
country
that's how that's how we do it in
america and with that same spirit
together
we can win these we can build
an economy where hard work is rewarded
in fact we will we can strengthen
our families in fact we will we can
defend
our country and increase our
opportunities around the world
in fact we will and we can renew the
promise of our democracy
and we well now
I know this is not going to be easy I've
been around awhile
case you haven't heard anybody say that
just thought I'd tell you and I know as
well
anyone how hard this job is I've seen it
up close and personal
all our presidents come into office
looking
so vigorous
and then we watch their hair rare gray
hair
well you won't see my hair turned white
and why
hi I've been telling us for years
and I may not be
candidate in this race but with your
help
I will be youngest woman president the
I
I hope you will give me that chance
I have spent my life fighting for
children
families in our country I'm not stopping
now you know
I've been called many things by many
people quitter is not one of them
I have to say like so much else in my
life I got that from my mother
she taught me that everybody needs a
chance
and champion she knew what it was like
not have either one
talked a lot about her since
we lost her because
I realized how much
I old to her not just because she was my
mom
and did a great job for me because
she was such credible example
courage resilience only parry parent
here at the age of 14 she was out around
working as a housemaid
I didn't know any that when I was a
little girl news you know we pick
cherries
backyard be played in she
media learn how to play tennis you tried
to teach
so
one with more success than the other but
years later
when I was old enough to understand I
asked her what kept you going
you know her answer was something very
simple
kindness from someone who believed she
mattered
first-grade teacher she had nothing to
eat at lunch
without embarrassing her brought extra
share
the woman whose house she cleaned
letting her go to high school so long as
her work was done
that was a bargain she left
to accept because people believed in her
at critical moments she believed in me
because her I believe in the potential
every American I have met hundreds of
thousands maybe millions of Americans
over the course very blessed life looked
in the
guys so many people little kids
thrust into foster care being treated
were life-threatening diseases dads who
just lost
job and don't know they're gonna go home
tell
their family moms who are single
doing the best they can to keep body and
soul part look
in those and
I believe so much that when you succeed
America sexy
and there's a role important role
reticle for our government to play we
all believe
that america has our back when we do our
best
we need a little help it'll be there but
there's also
a huge role for everybody else to play
too
want us to start looking each
other fellow
human beings fellow American want us to
figure out how through our own families
houses of worship our own businesses our
own communities
we can reach out to those in need
we can be smart and compassionate at the
same time
I want you to join me in this after
course I want you to help me bill
this campaign and to make it your own
want to talk to your
family your friends your neighbors I
want you to text join goin
247 246 in to go to Hillary Clinton dot
common
sign up to make calls and knock on doors
but more than that
want you to feel this campaign is not
about me
it's about all of us and it's about the
promise
up this country which is so unique
human history we can be
more open more generous more respectful
each other it really it
it upsets me when I hear some what said
in our political debates right now
but more than that really its my heart
wonder you know they not go
hear the same lessons I did in Sunday
school did they not seeing the same him
did they not have teachers who said you
know better
nor worse than anybody else they never
hear there but for the grace of God go
i.
where did this mean-spiritedness come
from we are such a blessed nation
we have so many more opportunities even
now with all of our challenges
anybody in human history has ever had
and so for me
this is about not only waging a campaign
and winning an election
but it is about what we do together
to build an america where if you do your
part
you reap the rewards where we don't
leave
anyone out or behind where we remember
that
there a lot little boys and girls like
my mom
who got that extra
help which most needed
I'm actually confident and optimistic
that this campaign can lay the
foundation for
us doing that with and for each other
again and yes we will have in America
where a father can tell his daughter you
can be anything you wanna be even
president
up the United States the
the
