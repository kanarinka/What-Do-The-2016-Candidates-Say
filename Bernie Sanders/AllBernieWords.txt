black arrow
thank you iowa
now we're just heard from President
Obama reminded me of something that I
think we should think about and that is
to reach child to our republican friends
and colleagues who are suffering from a
very very serious illness they suffer
from amnesia that 800,000 people of
month we're losing their drops day for
Cox that the world's financial system
was on the verge of collapse and they've
just four cocks that we were out all the
largest deficit in the history of the
united states and the last year of
george bush
so we wear our republican friends well
on the road to recovery and we tell them
what every American knows yeah we got
problems today but everybody knows
thanks to the president and the vice
president we have made real progress in
improving our economy
and we have to spy on precedent
obstructionism from right wing
Republican since all of you look great
work is chair of the Iowa Democratic
Party
our country and for doing today what few
americans are doing on Knox complaining
you are not turning our backs on the
political process and fighting back
campaign and the political revolution
when you see the middle class of this
country
disappearing and when you see people you
know what three jobs trying to cobble
together some incumbents home health
care of your dog Josh shoulders and say
that's the way it is
5 turn raise the minimum wage
dollars
and we fight for women workers when
millions of Americans today do not have
jobs due Friday for a massive federal
jobs program to rebuild our crumbling
infrastructure and millions of our
people back to work
you fight for an economy that works for
all americans and not just the
wealthiest people in this country
when you see when you use that the
United States has more income and wealth
inequality than any other major country
on earth and when you see all of the new
income being generated today is going to
the top 1% you know you know and the
american people know that that is not
borrow not sustain and you demand that
the wealthiest people in this country
and the largest corporations start
paying their fair share of taxes
that here in the United States we have
more people in jail than any other
country on earth
disproportionately black and Latino that
what we have talked to do and educate
should not more channels and across her
ex
when you saw the United States Supreme
Court of one of the worst in the history
of our country
past the Citizens United case
wealthiest people in this country who
are sexually by elections and by
candidates
demanded a constitutional amendment
turn and I promise that no nominee to
the supreme court will be voting to
support citizens united now while many
in the republican party continued to
deny the reality of climate change that
we live in transforming our energy
system away from fossil fuel
and you understand the moral imperative
moral imperative that we'd leave this
planet in a way that is healthy and
habitable for our children and our
grandchildren you are not on the
sidelines of these struggles you are in
the middle of this fight and that is
what our campaign is all about
when I began President of the United
States of America
and when we announced going to take on
the political and economic establishment
of this country very few people knew who
I was not the fact I may have a big
black we worried about 3% of the polls
we had no money we had no political
organization while in the last six
months
yes
hundreds of thousands of volunteers and
every state in this country are working
hard
including 7,000 right here in Iowa
300 Americans and withdrawing some of
the largest turnouts of any campaign
and today I can tell you and I'm very
proud of this that we have raised more
individual contributions than any
candidate in the history of our country
at this point
$30 now the fun begins the great
political experts in this campaign
unless you have a superpower unless
unless you go to the million billion has
the money
Democratic candidate for president who
does not have a super PAC
and we are gonna prove the experts in
this campaign
and by the way just to remember about
eight years ago
all of the political experts talked
about how another Democratic candidate
for president just couldn't win he was
100 its president
well iowa I think we are going to prove
the product it's wrong I believe we've
got one more time
now I my political life is well known as
some other candidates and the remaining
time but I have to talk to you about
some of the difficult choices decisions
that I have had to make some of the
forks in the road that I have
encountered in my career as mayor of
Burlington commodity us' congressman and
as a united states certainly when I was
elected mayor of the largest city in my
state by 10 votes
I think it's fair to say that it was a
shock to the establishment nobody
thought we could win that election and I
was opposed by the entire political
establishment that's the way was I faced
a fork in the road to the special
interests in my city and the political
establishment always stand up and fight
back and that is what we did
we doubled the voter turnout we elected
candidates and we made profound changes
to make her lick one of the United
States of America and I learned the
lesson and then left with the people to
take on big money ordinary people will
get involved in the political process
they will come out and vote and that's a
lesson we learn today republicans when
wet voter turnout is low we win out at
voter turnout is high now after I came
to congress elected in nineteen ninety
corporate America Wall Street the
administration and virtually all of the
corporate video they said you gotta vote
for this nafta trade agreement
break I didn't believe their audience i
voted against nafta I voted against
capital I voted against me with china
and history has proven those of us who
oppose those agreements were right
because in the last 14 years this
country has lost sixty thousand
factories and millions of jobs and let
me be clear about the current trade deal
that we are debating in congress the
trans-pacific partnership agreement is
not now nor has the gold standard of
trade agreements
I did not support it yesterday I do not
support it and I will
in nineteen my face another fork in the
road a very very difficult political
situation it was called the Defense of
Marriage Act
brought forth by republican led congress
and its purpose was clear to
discriminate against gays and lesbians
and the law
gay and lesbian rights were not popular
then I'm sorry to have to tell you that
that bill won by an overwhelming
majority in the House of three hundred
and forty to fifty seven that was not a
political easy now today
summer trying to rewrite history by
saying they voted for one anti-gay law
to stop something worse that's not the
case there was a small minority in the
house
oppose the discriminating against our
gay brothers and I am proud then I was
one of those Baptists
climate change climate change is real
climate change is caused by human
activity and climate change is already
causing devastating damage in america is
all over the world in American history
when almost all Republicans running for
president
reject science and the need for bold
action to combat climate change these
republicans prefer to take super PAC
contributions from the Koch brothers at
the fossil fuel industry rather than to
protect the planet for our kids and our
grandchildren and if you agree with me
about the urgent need to address climate
change then you know immediately what to
do about the Keystone pipeline
this was not a complicated should we
support the construction of a pipeline
across america accelerating the
extraction and transportation of some of
the dirtiest fossil fuel in the world to
me and that's why I have a proposed
pipeline
let me take you back to a very eventful
year and a decision in the modern
history of our country the years 2000
and true the issue is whether Congress
should vote to invade Iraq public
opinion and most of the video while for
the wall and it turns out that big
majorities in Congress or for all the
war as well
overwhelming support in the house and
the Senate for the walk I listen to what
Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld and I said
no they're not they're true
and I was right
riders
joy predicted about iraq turned out to
be right at all but that was a tough
vote I came to that fork in the road and
I took the right road even though it was
not popular at that time
while congress I opposed it time and
time again to rein in Wall straight to
fail to re-establish and bring back to
last season and we need to break up
these huge facts here are just saying
this we as a nation enormously difficult
and complex problems that's the truth
but I believe now and I have always
believed from the bottom of my heart
that yes these guys got the money they
have the power but when people stand
black and white Hispanic
straight young men and women game
when we stand there is nothing that we
cannot accomplish and I pledge to you
that every day I will fight for the
public interest not the corporate
interests of american society where the
ok what black or Latino full working
class just be cause politically
expedient at a given the republicans
that their reactionary agenda for the
billion but not for ordinary Americans
and we are going to defeat down thank
you all very much

Thank you. Iowa, thank you. Nine months ago,
we came to this beautiful state. We had no
political organization; we had no money; no
name recognition. And we were taking on the
most powerful political organization in the
United States of America.
And tonight while the results are still not
known, it looks like we are in a virtual tie.
And while the results are still not complete,
it looks like we'll have half of the Iowa
delegates. I want to take this opportunity
to congratulate Secretary Clinton, somebody
-- yep -- and her organization for waging
a very vigorous campaign.
And I want to thank Governor O'Malley. It's
never easy to lose. I've lost more than one
campaign. But he should know that he contributed
a whole lot to the dialogue, that he ran an
issue-oriented campaign, and he won the respect
of the American people... If I think about
what happened tonight, I think the people
of Iowa have sent a very profound message
to the political establishment, to the economic
establishment, and, by the way, to the media
establishment.
...Given the enormous crises facing our country,
it is just too late for establishment politics
and establishment economics. What the American
people have said — and by the way, I hear
this not just from progressives, I hear it
from conservatives, I hear it from moderates
— that is: 'We can no longer continue to
have a corrupt campaign finance system.' 
I am the former chairman of the Senate veteran's
committee. In that capacity, not only have
I worked hard to try to protect the interest
of our veterans, I've had the privilege of
meeting so many, men and women, who put their
lives on the line to defend us and protect
our way of life.
And what they were protecting is an American
democracy of: One person, one vote. Not billionaires
buying elections. I am overwhelmed, and I
am moved by the fact that millions of people
throughout this country have helped volunteer
in our campaign, that three -- we have received
in this campaign 3.5 million individual contributions.
People who went to BernieSanders.com. And
you know what the average contribution was?
It was $27!
We do not represent the interests of the billionaire
class, Wall Street or corporate America. We
don't want their money. We will -- and I am
very proud to tell you, we are the only candidate
on the Democratic side without a super PAC.
And the reason that we have done so well here
in Iowa, the reason I believe we're going
to do so well in New Hampshire, and in the
other states that follow, the reason is, the
American people are saying, 'no to a rigged
economy.' They no longer want to see an economy
in which the average American works longer
hours for low wages while almost all new income
and wealth is going to the top 1%.
What the American people understand is this
country was based and is based on fairness.
It is not fair when the top 1/10th of 1% today
owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%.
It is not fair when the 20 wealthiest people
in this country own more wealth than the bottom
half of America. So you guys ready for a radical
idea? Well, so is America. And that radical
idea is, we are going to create an economy
that works for working families not just the
billionaire class.
And when millions of our people are working
for starvation wages, we are going to raise
the minimum wage to $15 an hour. And, yes,
we are going to have pay equity for women.
I've been all over this state of Iowa: We
have spoken to some 70,000 people, and in
meeting after meeting, I hear people standing
up and, they say: 'Bernie, I went to college.
I graduated college — now I am 60, 80, 90
thousand dollars in debt. That is crazy. That
is crazy. They want to get a decent education;
they should not be punished.
That is why I believe in the year 2016, public
colleges and universities should be tuition
free. And then my critics say, well, Bernie,
that's a great idea, all this free stuff,
how are you going to pay for it? I will tell
you how we will pay for it, we are going to
impose a tax on Wall Street speculation. The
greed, the recklessness and the illegal behavior
of Wall Street drove this economy to its knees.
The American people bailed out Wall Street,
now it's Wall Street's time to help the middle
class. And when we talk about transforming
America. We will end the disgrace of having
more people in jail than any other country.
Disproportionately African-American and Latino.
What we are going to do is provide jobs and
education for our kids not more jails and
incarceration. I'll tell you something that
really does astound me. I'm on the senate
energy committee — on the senate environmental
committee — I have talked to scientists
all over the world. The debate is over: Climate
change is real. And we have a moral responsibility
to work with countries throughout the world
to transform our energy system away from fossil
fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable
energy.
What amazes me, what totally amazes me, is
that we have not one Republican candidate
for president prepared to come up and tell
us, and agree with what virtually all scientists
agree with, and you know why they are not
prepared to do that? Because on the day that
they do acknowledge the reality of climate
change and call for change, you know what
happens? They're going to lose their campaign
funds from the Koch brothers and the fossil
fuel (industry) ...
So I say to the Republicans, stop worrying
about your campaign funds from big oil or
the Koch brothers worry about the planet you're
going to be leaving your children and your
grandchildren. Now, I have been criticized
during this campaign for many, many things.
Every single day. That's okay. That's okay.
But let me repeat what I believe. I believe
that at a time when every major country on
Earth guarantees health care to all people
as a right, that I believe that we should
do the same in the United States of America.
So for all of my critics out there in the
Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post
and in corporate America, wherever you may
be, let me tell you straight up, yes, I believe
that health care is a right, not a privilege!
And that is why I believe in a Medicare for
all single payer program which will not only
guarantee health care to all, it will not
only end the pharmaceutical ripoff of the
American people but it will save the middle
class family, the average middle-class family
thousands of dollars a year in health care
costs.
Let me conclude by saying what no other candidate
for president will tell you. And that is that
no president, not Bernie Sanders, not anybody
else, will be able to bring about the changes
that the working families and the middle class
of this country, that our children, that the
seniors, our seniors deserve. No one president
can do it because the powers that be, Wall
Street with their endless supply of money,
corporate America, the large campaign donors
are so powerful that no president can do what
has to be done alone. And that is why -- and
that is why what Iowa has begun tonight is
a political revolution.
A political revolution that says when millions
of people come together, including those who've
given up on the political process, they're
so dismayed and so frustrated with what goes
on in Washington, with young people who before
had never been involved in the political process,
when young people and working people and seniors
begin to stand up and say loudly and clearly,
enough is enough, that our government, the
government of our great country belongs to
all of us and not just a handful of billionaires,
when that happens we will transform this country.
Thank you all very much.

close relations I thank her for her call
and I congratulate her and her
supporters with a vigorous campaign
to thank the many many thousands of
volunteers here in the granite state
made phone calls and knocked on a heck
of a lot of doors energy thank you all
great campaign
we have sent the message that will echo
from Wall Street to Washington from
Maine to California
the government of our great country
belongs to all of the people and not
just a handful of wealthy campaign
contributors and they're super PACs
months ago we began our campaign here in
new hampshire we had no campaign
organization we had no money and we were
taking on the most powerful political
organization in the United States of
America with what appears to be a
record-breaking voter turnout
and are safe
August energy and the excitement that
the democratic party will need to
succeed in November
in terms of an enthusiastic and arrivals
electorate people came out in large
numbers that is what will happen all
over
Democrats and progressives win when
voter turnout is high when people are
demoralized and voter turnout is low
we serve notice to the political and
economic establishment of this country
that the american people will not
continue to accept a corrupt campaign
finances and we will not accept a rigged
economy in which ordinary Americans work
for low wages while only in Commonwealth
goes to the top one percent
take this opportunity to congratulate
Secretary Clinton and her organization
its supporters who waging a vigorous
campaign I hope that in the days ahead
we can continue to wage a strong
issue-oriented campaign and bring
we all remember and this is a message
not just to our opponents but to those
who support me as well that we will need
to come together in a few months and
unite this party and their slaves
shouldn't because the right wing
republicans we oppose must not be
allowed to gain the president
remember the last time Republicans
occupied the White House their
trickle-down economic policies drove us
into the worst economic downturn since
the depression of the nineteen thirties
though we will not allow huge tax breaks
for billionaires
packed huge cuts to Social Security
federal Medicare Medicaid and education
back into the white house a political
party which is sold the whole to the
fossil fuel industry that they cannot
even acknowledge the scientific reality
of climate change
Hampshire have sent a profound message
to the political establishment economic
establishment and by the way to the
media establishment
same old establishment politics and
establishment economics people want real
change
I hear this not just for progressives
but for conservatives and moderates is
that we can no longer continue to have a
campaign finance system in which wall
street and the billionaire class are
able to buy elections
political view maybe understand that
that is not what democracy is about that
is what I'm talking about
we will allow them to continue
and I do not want a superclass
overwhelms I am deeply moved from more
than I can express in words by the fact
that our campaigns financial support
comes from more than one million
Americans have made more than three
point seven million individual
contributions
than any candidate in the history of the
United States
up until this point it election
average contribution was seven
going tonight
city to hold a fundraiser on wall street
I'm going to hold a fundraiser right
here right now
across America please go to Bernie
Sanders dot com and contribute
raise the funds we need whether it's 10
bucks or twenty bucks or 50 bucks how
was raised the money we need to take the
fight to South Carolina and the stakes
pretty quick
American people understand is that our
great country was based on a simple
principle and that principle various let
me be very clear it is not fair when we
have more income and wealth inequality
today that almost any major country on
earth and when the top one-tenth of one
percent now almost as much well as the
bottom 90% that's not so
20 wealthiest people in this country now
own more wealth than the bottom half of
the american people
ready for a radical idea and economy
and when they should wages we've got a
raise
yes we are going to make public colleges
and universities 23
of Americans struggling with horrendous
levels of student debt we are going to
substantially ease the burden
people should not be financially
distressed for decades for the crime the
crime of trying to get higher education
that's absurd
my critics say you know bernie is a
great idea until all this free stuff how
you're going to pay for it I will tell
you how it go to pay for it
going to impose a tax on Wall Street
speculation
recklessly and the illegal behavior of
Wall Street
our own economy two weeks DS the
American people bailed out Wall Street
now it's wall street's time to help the
middle class
America it means ending the disgrace of
this country having more people in jail
than any other country in the world
disproportionately african-american and
Latino
are we going to fight and institutional
racism and a broken criminal justice
jobs and education for our young people
not journals and incarceration
is a member of the energy committee in
the senate and the Environmental
Committee the debate is over climate
change is real
and it is already causing devastating
problems in this country and around the
world we have a moral responsibility to
work with countries throughout the world
to transform our energy system away from
fossil fuel to energy efficiency and
sustainable energy
criticized during this campaign for many
many things every single day that's ok
it's alright throwing everything at me
except the kitchen sink and I have the
feeling that kitchen see is coming
pretty soon as well
is thinking big not small it's about
having the courage to reject the status
quo
when every major country on earth
guarantees healthcare to all of their
people we should be doing the same in
our great country President Obama's
leadership the Affordable Care Act has
been an important step forward
no question about it but we can and must
do that and even greater with large
deductibles and co-payments we should
not be paying by fall the highest prices
in the world for prescription drugs at a
time
listen to this when the top three drug
companies in this country made 45
billion dollars in profit last year
and let me tell you something when we
make it to the white house
pharmaceutical industry will continue to
report we continue to spend far from
capitol then do the people of any other
nation all of whom guarantee health care
to all of the people and that is why I
believe in a Medicare for All
single-payer program
but will save the average middle-class
family thousands of dollars a year in
health care costs friends we all know
that we live in a dangerous and complex
world as President I will defend this
nation but I will do it responsibly i
voted against the war in Iraq
go right
votes
combating terrorists who would do us
home we cannot and should not be the
policeman of the world should we bear
the burden of fighting terrorism alone
in the middle east United States must be
part of an international coalition
sustained by nations in the region there
have the means to protect themselves
together we must it will destroy Isis
what we should do it in a way that does
not good
our young men and women in the military
into perpetual warfare in the quiet
fix our broken immigration system that
divides families and create a path
toward citizenship
hard-working people
and that's received so that people can
live in dignity
crumbling infrastructure and when we do
that we create millions of decent paying
jobs pursue the fight for women's rights
for gay rights for disability rights
stronger and stronger opposition protect
the right of a woman to control our own
body
protect the men and women who serve our
nation in uniform and protect our
veterans to defend
we must tell the billionaire class in
the 1% that they cannot have it all at a
time of massive wealth and income
inequality the wealthiest people and
largest corporations in this country
will start paying their fair share of
taxes
I am the son of a Polish immigrants came
to this country speaking no English and
having no money
my father worked every day of his life a
whole lot my mom and dad and brother I
grew up in a small three and a half room
rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn
New York always dream of moving out of
that apartment getting a home of our own
but you never realize the truth is that
neither one of my parents could ever
dream would be here tonight
standing before you as a candidate for
president of the United States
and this is the promise we must keep
alive for future generations what began
last week along with voters here in new
hampshire confirm tonight is nothing
short of the beginning of a political
revolution
of our people together it will bring
together working people given up on the
political process it will bring young
people in the political process he knows
Asian Americans Native Americans
female and people who immigrated here
and clearly that the government of our
songs to all of us not just a few
wealthy campaign contributors this
campaign is about that is what the
political revolution is about solo
Hampshire thank you again and now it's
odd
South Carolina up FBI

lives
this afternoon
political revolution contributed $25 $50
campaign raises money $25 at a time
around some rich person's dining room
living room where people are putting in
a hundred thousand dollars into a super
PAC this is a peoples meeting at the
only nine billion major candidate who
does not have a super PAC
I do not represent the agenda of the
billionaire class or corporate America I
don't want to I don't need their money
is about is just what we're doing right
now
last night just to give you an example
we had some 3,500 house bodies all over
america
I am told told the LA with 1,600 people
are all over the country we had 800,000
people coming out over 650,000 people
need individual contributions averaging
$30 apiece
a result of last night's debate I am
told that we have raised two million
$35
what I raised right now there are many
London's who believe that the only way a
candidate to run a successful campaign
to have a super PAC
down on one's needs before the
millionaires and billionaires big damper
money and what we are showing years we
can run a people-oriented campaign
funded by the pool
country we had a great rally here a few
months ago and I like in a sense the god
knows how many thousands of people one
guy came up to me you know what I like
about what you're doing is you're
treating us as if we were intelligent
human beings
campaign is about about demanding that
all of us and the media start talking
about the real issues facing this time
I slipped on a banana peel leaving here
with me in the front page but when we
talk about the great crises facing this
country to get media attention for a lot
of obvious reasons and if I was standing
here tonight and making some vicious
attack against Hillary Clinton or
anybody else about why the middle class
is disappearing and almost all new
income and wealth is going to the top
one percent not a big story so what the
political revolution is is forcing a
debate not about trivial but about the
real issues
country faces serious different people
have different ideas but I think they
are tired of seeing politics looked at
it as if it were a baseball game or a
soap opera on the world but on some of
the major issues I think as the nation
we have got right now in this country we
have more income and wealth inequality
than any other major country on earth
and it is worse today than at any time
since the late nineteen twenties do we
find it morally or economically
acceptable on TV but are one tenth of
one percent one tenth of one percent
owns almost as much well as the bottom
90%
LA California and Vermont all over this
country we all know people who are
working incredibly long hours in fact I
don't know how many of you know this we
americans work the longest hours of any
other industrialized country people are
working $56 week the working two jobs
and three journals and yet 58 percent of
all income generated in this country is
going to the top one percent
for a while
we are talking about an economy that is
rich and let me give you an example of
what you got people all over LA they
worked in for really low wages and yet
in the last two years alone 15
wealthiest people in this country were
ready zillionaires fifteen people saw
their wealth increase by over a hundred
and fifty billion dollars fifteen people
that is more well that is owned by the
bottom hundred and thirty million
Americans so what you have right now is
a rigged economy by which the rich get
richer everybody else gets we have got
to create an economy in America and we
can which works for working families not
just billionaire
tragedy that we have got to address
which is pretty much not talked about by
politicians or the media and that is
number one real unemployment which means
people who have given up looking for
work and millions of people working part
time when they want to work full time
when you add all that together
unemployed box on the one who work
full-time people given up looking for
work
real unemployment in this country 10%
and then let me tell you something which
is never discussed and that is the
tragedy of youth unemployment in America
real unemployment and underemployment
years for kids between 17 and 22 are
high school graduates then drop out of
high school graduates and this is what
they said white kids the number is 31%
kids the number is 36% for african
American young people the number is 51%
we don't talk about this issue and
that's why last night I said I am tired
of hillary's emails let's talk about
reelection
what does when millions of young people
disproportionately Latino and
african-american I'm not in school and
what it means is a five and a half
million of them for Burlington Vermont
so Los Angeles California I hanging out
on street corners and attempted to get
into trouble and the result of that in
my view contributes to the fact that we
in America have more people in jail than
any other country on earth including
China
point two million people are in jail
today and it cost to taxpayers eighty
billion dollars a year
families are being torn apart we're
spending huge sums of taxpayer money
locked in people now it seems to be that
it makes a lot more sense for us to be
investing in education and jobs rather
than jails
lot less expensive for us to send young
people to the University of California
to lock them up
another issue all of these issues are
interconnected one of the things you
learn you know when is the
interconnectedness of all of these
issues here's another reason why write
it and that right now we have hundreds
of thousands of bright young people in
this country who have done well in
schools were qualified they can not get
a college education for one reason and
that is their families lack the funds
raised it is unfair to those young
people to say you're never gonna make it
into the middle class you're never gonna
be a doctor or a scientist or engineer
or a nurse you never gonna be able to do
that because you can't afford to go to
college that is unfair but what is even
crazier is that as a nation we need to
type all of the intellectual capability
that weekend
why I have introduced legislation which
will implement as president to make
every public college and university in
America tuition free
opponents think this is a real far I'll
radical idea it's really not right fifty
years ago fifty years ago if you were
able to graduate high school
the likelihood was that you will be able
to go out and get a pretty good job
today a college degree is the equivalent
of what I high school degree was fifty
years ago had public education in this
country for way longer than a hundred
years it is time now to include colleges
as part of free public education
and our legislation also addresses the
crisis of millions of people struggling
with very very high student debt pretty
simple why should you if you have
student debt be paying six eight 10
percent interest rates when you can
refinance your home but two or three
percent people to refinance and get the
government out of profiteering also
working class
making public colleges and universities
tuition-free why this is a revolutionary
idea is not just because it makes life
easier obviously for those people who go
to college but it does something else
even more important to a kid in the
fifth grade 6 grade in LA or in
burlington vermont that no matter what
the income of your family is and I grew
up in a family that never had a lot of
money but no matter what your income is
if you study hard if you take school
seriously if you do well you will be
able to get a college education
billion dollars on wall street
the recklessness and illegal behavior on
Wall Street drove this country into the
worst economic downturn in modern
history
Wall Street came rolling to the middle
class of this country and they said
louise bail us out I voted against the
way but now that we are seeing CEO's
Wall Street make a new compensation
packages it is their time to bail out
the middle class
you know it's a funny thing somebody
just yell out its jail time to it is it
is an interesting statement on our very
broken criminal justice system which has
more people in jail than any other
country but not as CEOs over wall street
people who sold marijuana in jail
without people have destroyed the
american economy
about major issues facing our country
and I'm just taking off some of them
afternoon there is one issue that
impacts every other issue and died as a
result of the Supreme Court's decision
in Citizens United finance system is now
corrupt and it is undermining the
foundations of American democracy and
that's just the simple truth
where every spring there all week old
town meetings people come together argue
about how much they're going to spend on
the schools and on the roads and their
budgets and all that stuff
everybody's things off they argue one
vote we are now living under a campaign
finance system where you have one vote
the Koch brothers have one vote each
plus nine hundred million dollars to buy
canada days
why I promise you that any nominee of
mind to the United States Supreme Court
will make it loud and clear that he or
she will be voting to overturn
that I am passionate believer in a very
radical concept called democracy in
human history
accuracy is a pretty new one hundred
years old and yet what we are seeing
right now is a result of citizens united
is a situation where the Koch brothers
alone will be spending more money in
this campaign cycle of the Democratic or
Republican politics when you got one
family spending more money than either
of the two major political parties
you're not talking about democracy
you're talking about a lunch date we've
got a
one of the day win when turnout so low
they win when they can suppress the vote
of people of color of low-income people
old people young people so not only do
we have to frontally take on voter
suppression and what I will do is
president used to make it very clear
that in 50 states in this country if
somebody is 18 years of age that person
is registered to vote and discuss
public funding of elections and the
reason I say that the reason I say that
is your gonna do that too
just yelled out of getting a lot of help
you guys are helping me write my
speeches I appreciate that young lady
has said if we are serious about
democracy when we give the American
people the day off and make
international
democracy I want I want anybody who is
interested in public service whether
they're conservative progressive
moderate whatever I want them to be able
to say you know what I'm gonna run for
office and I want them to be able to run
for office without having to big wealthy
people for campaign contributions
setters already a lot about another
issue of enormous consequence is our
moral responsibility France's recently
reminded of this of this moral
responsibility to leave this planet in a
way that is healthy inhabitable for our
kids and our grandchildren
there is no longer a debate the
scientific community is virtually
unanimous climate change is real it is
caused by human activity is already
causing devastating problems in our
country and all over the world that's
the bad news here's the good news is if
we are aggressive is we understand the
enormity of this problem if we lead the
world and work with russia and China and
India and other countries we can
transform our energy system globally
away from fossil fuel energy efficiency
and sustainable
when we talk about our economy what this
campaign is saying to the billionaire
class is something that is pretty simple
and that is they cannot continue to have
it all their greed is destroying this
nation and if I have anything to say
about it and i truly will as president
of the united states
in the wealthiest people in this country
will finally start paying their fair
share of taxes
everybody knows that we have in this
country today 11 million undocumented
people now what has disturbed me very
very much we have a number of republican
candidates are not only done addressing
the real issue of immigration reform
they are scooping to racist attacks
against the Latino community
2015 we have been fighting against
racism for hundreds of views on
immigration but it is not acceptable to
stoop to racist attacks against the
mexican people
when a person in this country is
undocumented when a person in this
country has no legal rights that person
is very often exploited and that person
worker cannot stand up for his or her
rights so windows workers are exploited
denied fair wages and benefits it not
only impacts them it impacts every
worker in america and leads us to a race
to the bottom
I believe that we need to provide legal
status to all people who are
undocumented as soon as possible and
what remains in my heart I had a couple
of months ago his own in Phoenix and
after a rally but we had a number of
young Latino girls teenagers came up to
me and there were tears coming out of
their cheeks down their cheeks as they
express their fear the day or their
parents could be our job is to unite
families not to divide families
is to go forward with comprehensive
immigration reform and a path toward
citizenship
the republicans refuse to cooperate I'll
job is the house for president who will
use the power of executive orders
immigration reform we have got to the
nation deal with institutional racism at
a broken criminal justice system
very very very long time african
americans have been arrested and killed
during the arrest process they have been
killed while in custody and the system
has allowed police departments to get
away with that but with the rise of this
when the american people see a video of
people like Sondra bland and many others
what the american people are saying this
is not acceptable
burlington vermont three years
will come here in the winter I work very
closely with the police department which
drew a Burlington is true of police
departments all of this country that is
most cops work really hard they're
honest it is a very difficult job also
any police officer as well as any public
official and that police officer breaks
he must be held accountable
police talk about criminal justice I
think all of us on the slim that there
is something profoundly wrong in a
nation when we see it seems God knows
every week every month another mass
killing and what about a person who
walks into an elementary school in kills
children what's another individual water
and the Whitchurch goes on to a Bible
study class and then kills nine people
because the color of their skin is
different than yours clearly what we
need to do in my view is create a
consensus a consensus which I believe
exists in this country was sensible gun
control legislation
everything those guns to make sure they
are able to get the help they need when
they need
closed in my office and I am sure that
governors and senator dole the senators
and members of congress public officials
over America medical schools and so you
know I'm worried about my brother I
don't know what he's going to do to
himself was somebody else and we
desperately looking out for help and we
can't find anything now that we can
afford and then we see what that
inaction means when we look at the front
page of the newspaper and see you know
the mass killing and another tragedy so
in my view what we should absolutely
make certain is that when people need
counseling and they need mental health
treatment they get it when they needed
not too much
where we are as a nation you read in the
media tells you that we are very divided
nation and to some degree that's true
the differences of opinion on issues
like gay marriage or abortion guns there
is a real delight in this country
quality huge issues but on the other
hand what I want to tell you is there is
a lot more commonality a lot more common
interest among people then many would be
able to believe
the ranking member on the Budget
Committee representing the democrats and
here is what the republican budget is
about the republican budget I want you
to be thinking for a moment these are
the guys who control the house and the
USA and this is what their budget is and
if you think I'm exaggerating and
kidding you know go to the internet and
check it out this is the truth this is
why I say that because it's hard to
believe what the republican budget says
is let us and the Affordable Care Act
make massive cuts in medicaid and throat
27 million people without health
insurance
now we are the only major country under
the doesn't guarantee healthcare 200
people something I want to change and
Republicans want to throw twenty seven
million people and when you ask the
ranking member I said call me if you
gonna throw twenty seven million people
without health insurance
how many thousands will become much
thicker than they should have been they
have no response at all there are and
then you go on to another issue
publicans well at a time when it is
harder and harder for working-class
families to send their kids to college
let's cut Pell Grants line 90 billion
dollars over ten year period let's make
it even harder
and by the way when families here in los
angeles city vermont are struggling to
put food on the table that's billions of
dollars in cuts in nutrition programs
and by the way after cutting health care
and nutrition and environmental programs
they have another brilliant idea and
that is why don't we provide over two
hundred and fifty billion dollars in tax
breaks to be us two tenths of one
percent
because when the american people
understand that and the media doesn't
report the store but when the american
people understand that they say these
kinds of crazy world of the living it
get away with that because in the last
election sixty-three percent of the
American people did in boats eighty
percent of young people didn't vote and
there are millions of people who know
very very little about what goes on in
washington millions of people don't even
know which political party controls the
USA house of the US senate know it's a
fact we are trying to do in this
campaign and what I mean by waging a
political revolution is to bring people
together to stand up and demand that the
United States government represents all
of us and not just a handful of
never comes from the top down it always
comes from the bottom
people struggle to build the trade union
movement so that workers could engage in
collective bargaining and earn decent
wages and benefits millions of
african-americans in their white house
lawyers and Hispanic outlines an
American allies fought to end racist
legislation in this country
but finally millions of people came
together to be president
notwithstanding the color of his skin
well women struggle in said sorry we are
not going to be second-class citizens in
america
going to be able to control our own
bodies
allies struggled to make that happen
a very long time ago somebody jumped up
and said you know I think gay marriage
should be legal in every state in
America somebody would have told them
they're crazy couldn't have to fight
what happened is the gay community in
their street allies said you know what
we are going to end homophobia in this
country
that real change can happen when we do
not allow them to divide by the color of
our skin by whether we are gay or
straight white whether we were born in
America or not in america whether we're
a woman or a man
when we stand united fighting for our
kids and our parents by the millions
making this political revolution there
is nothing nothing we cannot accomplish

old
larger say but you know super PACs are
in my mind
undermined american democracy and I
wanted to not just talk the talk walk
the walk so I said ok when I can do a
super PAC raise money all of you know
just watching them run for national
office so we saw actually reached out to
working families in the middle class of
this country possibly an amazing thing
happened that I never dreamed would have
had and that as as of today we have
received two and a half million
individual contributions more individual
contributions than any candidate in the
history of the United States
bush
drug companies change in this country
and you can do it with the support of
the middle class of this country that is
what we're trying to do it a pretty
proud of them know what's also happened
as you know when we started this
campaign I think the first national
polls how to say something like three
percent but over the last of those
numbers have gone up and they brought up
here or you know I when I gotta tell you
you're beautiful state we are seeing
just extraordinary level of enthusiasm
energy of support as of today one of the
reasons I think we have an excellent
chance to win here is that s up today we
will have had meetings like this and
lodging meetings where some 40,000 I
have come out to discuss the important
issues facing this country 40,000 in
this campaign as of today by the end of
this campaign year and I what I think
will probably
talking to people just like you want
american democracy and that's pretty
good so we have a lot of people many
thousands of all he is talking to people
making phone calls and I think that's
why we're going to win this
old-fashioned way person to person now I
think also one of the reasons we have
been successful in this campaign because
we are talking about the very very
serious issues facing the american
people and a lot of politics in America
especially because of the media does not
allow for serious discussion from a
media perspective what politics is about
its a soak up what happened if the
person person's personal life
holes it's money it's all kinds of
things but it's not really the issues
impacting the American people in a
democratic society what politics should
be about his what's going on in the
country what's wrong
how we come together to change how we
thought that's kind of what politics
should be about not ripping apart
everybody doing on the best in the world
dummies and terrible people so let's
talk about some of the important issues
facing this country and at the top of my
list are probably more and more people I
think of discussing this issue is the
issue of the grotesque level of income
and wealth inequality in this country
today we have the top one tenth of one
percent only almost as much well as the
bottle 90%
how do we feel how we feel about 20
wealthiest people in this country only
more well fifty percent of the American
people
welcome you to reflect upon think about
you have one family in America owning
more wealth than the bottom forty
percent of the emergence turns out that
the Walton family is the major recipient
of welfare country many people in this
country because they are paying their
workers wages that are so low and
benefits that are so bad that many of
their workers are on food stamps many of
their workers are on medicaid and many
other workers are in subsidized housing
so generous and kind people in the
middle class are helping to subsidize
the wealthiest family in America and
they very much appreciate
you have come up to help their employees
but you know I've got a radical idea
maybe they should pay it and he said
is that we are saying in my state and in
your people working incredibly long
hours trying to bring in enough income
and health care to sustain their not
uncommon for people to be working two or
three jobs I suspect the juniors well
not uncommon for mom to be working down
to be working
turns out that our people are working
longer hours of any people in the
industrialized world
japanese worker long as we look and yet
all of the hard work of the american
people it turns out that 58 percent of
all new income generated in this country
goes to the top one percent but that
working incredible hours 58 percent goes
to the top one percent so what we are
living in what this campaign is
addressing is the fact that we have a
rigged economy a rigged economy and
unfair economy that despite how hard
ordinary people working and going to the
top one percent so what this campaign is
about you suggesting a very radical of
you want a radical idea is a radical
idea what about an economy that works
for the middle class and not just a
handful of billionaires
and maintained by a corrupt campaign
finance system ever since the supreme
court by a five-to-four decision voted
for citizens united what that decision
said to the wealthiest people in this
country is you guys already own
much of the American economy now even
give you the opportunity to buy the
United States government now the former
chairman of the Committee on Veterans
Affairs on a river during hard we can
talk about that later but I talked to
veterans from World War two career was
it really breaks my heart to see that
people put their lives on the line to
defend american democracy and now you
have a handful of billionaires
literally able to buy elections in this
country you have one example something
over here and I will usually he was the
first caucus in the country there was a
court has held several months ago by a
gentleman named Sheldon Adelson you know
here's a multi billionaire who
contributes very heavily and what it did
several months ago in the Adelson corpus
is invited
leading Republican candidates to come
before him to tell him walk they would
do a multi-billionaire if they were
elected president and one of them will
end up getting his nomination and will
be the recipient of tens of millions of
dollars or maybe hundreds of stalls
bottom line is when you have the Koch
brothers and a few of their friends
prepared to spend nine hundred million
dollars on this campus
when Sheldon Adelson has his own caucus
is not democracy that is call oligarchy
and together we have got to change that
now when we talk about the economy it's
important to talk about jobs every month
federal government comes out of a series
of reports on unemployment sorts but one
that appears on the front pages of the
papers is official employment official
unofficial US official report tells us
that official unemployment today is five
percent believe that unemployment
workers 5% truth is there's another and
the other report which doesn't get as
much attention tells us that if you
include people who have given up looking
for work and people who are working part
time when they won't work full time real
unemployment is close to 10% about 9.9
on top of that there is the real crisis
that very few people talk about
regarding youth unemployment had a study
done to me a few months ago this is what
they say
for high school graduates not dropouts
my kids terms of unemployment and
underemployment 33 percent between the
ages of 17 and 20 latino kids 36 percent
african-american kids 51 now if anybody
in this room doesn't see the correlation
between high rates of youth unemployment
and the fact that we have more people in
jail than any other country on earth you
would be missing a very important so
here is another very radical idea second
radical idea of the day and no one is
fleeing the oil
instead of investing in jails in
incarceration for our kids what about
investing in jobs and education
and there is more than enough work to be
done in this country we have an
infrastructure roads bridges rail system
wastewater plants watered that in many
parts of this country literally grown
and that's why I have called for a one
trillion dollar investment one trillion
dollar investment what thirteen million
people back to work making our country
more efficient and safe let's rebuild
our infrastructure
the reason that sometimes a PhD in
economics to figure out that the reason
as to why people are working such long
hours has everything to do with the fact
that wages are you can do the arithmetic
as well as I can but somebody who works
for eight bucks an hour a week fifty
year is not going to earn enough money
to take care of himself or herself let
alone and that is why I believe that
anyone in America who works 40 hours a
week should not be living in poverty
that's why I believe we should raise the
minimum wage to a living wage $15 over
the next
that every man in this room there with
the women and make sure that we passed
pay equity for women workers
reason rational economic reason why
women should be making 79 cents on the
dollar compared to men that is just
old-fashioned sexism and together we are
going to change that
of politicians dropping through this and
many republicans talk about family dogs
just laws of their wealthy families of
inmates can I ask you to keep up with
keeping that light off and and they are
really into family values but does
everybody in this room know what they
mean by Sam divides what they need by
family bonds is that no one in this room
in the state in this country should be
able to control your own body I strongly
disagree
now I'm not shocked you tell you that
there is a lot of hypocrisy in politics
I know you'll be shocked when I think
there is no greater example of hypocrisy
and when it comes to a woman's right to
choose
republicans running all over this
country telling us how much they hate
the federal government how much they
hate government journal they want to cut
Social Security and Medicare investigate
everything else they want to get the
government watch your backs they want to
live your life three country make your
own decision accepts when it comes to
the very personal decision that women
sometimes have to make and then they
love the government and they want to go
to tell every woman in America
her choice should be that's wrong that's
hypocrisy I will fight that tooth
also what we talked about republican
family values but they also mean is that
gay people in this country should not
have the right to marry I strongly
disagree with us
27 grandchildren and what I talked about
international of the united states only
country on earth does not guarantee paid
family and medical
of working-class women all low-income
women there is a strong likelihood that
they will be forced to separate
themselves from those newborn baby one
week after birth
two weeks after birth to go back to work
earn enough income to do in my view that
is not what family values are about that
is the very opposite of what of family
values about a mom and dad have the
right to stay home with a newborn baby
you have a right to stay home with your
kids if your son or daughter is ill if
your mom or dad is and that is why I
should we will support and fight for
three months of paid fairly dramatically
now when we talk about our economy have
the courage to take on some extremely
powerful special interests because at
the end of the day without being too
rhetorical here real change never takes
place without struggle that's been the
history of the united states whether
it's been a civil rights movement has
been workers movements in unions whether
it's been the women's movement the
environmental movement the game that's
what happens when we talk about our
economy we have got to understand that
the greed the recklessness and the
illegal behavior of Wall Street is doing
disastrous things working men and women
in this country now everybody in this
room those that wall street's behavior
crashed the economy
2000 and so you all know that millions
of people lost their jobs they've lost
their homes they lost their life savings
and you helped bail them out they came
running the congress and they said
police bail out against Michael congress
bail them out now
today eight years later you may not be
shocked to know that the three largest
three out of the four largest financial
institutions in america are much bigger
than they were when you bailed them out
because they were too big to fail you
might not be shocked to know that the
six largest financial institutions have
assets equivalent to 60 percent of the
GDP of the United States that they issue
two-thirds of the credit cards and
one-third of the mortgages you might now
be shocked to know that since 2000 and
nine major financial institutions in
this country have paid over to
hundred billion dollars in fines for
illegal activities or reached
settlements with the government to avoid
reading over two hundred billion dollars
now mind you when you have a financial
institution too big to fail it is too
big to exist I believe we should break
there
small businesses farmers homeowners not
as we currently have on wall street and
I love unto itself only concerned about
making as much money as they can for
themselves
also you know when we've talked about
this why it is that so many of our
people of the moralizing politically why
so many people have given up on our
democracy I think it has a lot to do a
lot of factors out there but here's one
of them people see market picked up for
the possession of marijuana gets
arrested has a criminal record
see somebody else minor crime has a
police record and yet the CEOs of Wall
Street firms firms that as I mentioned
up a two hundred billion dollars in
fines for illegal activities not one has
been charged with a crime not one of
them has a police so I believe maybe I'm
old-fashioned about this we should not
have banks that are too big to fail what
bankers who are too big to jail
all people in power
earlier we have a corrupt old-fashioned
conservative but what democracy means to
me is one person one vote so if we were
here all together and we're trying to
decide something you gotta vote
everybody has an equal vote majority
rules that's kind of my vision of
democracy majority rules one-person
one-vote but clearly that has been
corrupted by the Citizens United
decision so let me make a promise to you
that if elected president
no not in need of mind to the supreme
court will get that position unless he
or she makes it very very clear and loud
that they will vote to overturn Citizens
United
because I am a passionate believer in
democracy I want this country to have
one larger one of the higher voter
turnouts in the world
not one of the low voter turnout since
will live on our young people are just
going from high school just before I
want our kids to be thinking about the
important issues I want serious debate
in this country about serious issues and
I will do everything that I can to
expand voter turnout among many other
things I will click on those republican
governors and legislators were going out
of their way to suppress the vote to
make it harder for people in this
country devote our job is to make it
easier
when we talk about this country
everybody here knows that if our economy
is going to be successful we need to
have the best educated workforce in the
world and unfortunately that is no
longer the case of once while it is not
the case
to give you one absurd exam right now as
we speak there are hundreds of thousands
of bright and qualified young people who
have the background have the building to
go to college but cannot go to college
for one reason and that reason is their
families lack the funds to me that he is
not only really unfair to those people
but it is absurd as we look at our
future economy where we need to tell all
of the intellectual capabilities of
people how many scientists and engineers
in great teaches there who cannot afford
to go to college right now so that is
why I will fight to make sure that every
public college and university in america
is tuition free
we've got to deal with another crisis
outrageously high level of student debt
in this country you have millions of
people I've been reading a lot of your
in Iowa who are carrying that some
90,000 $300,000 whatever reduce into I
met a woman to promote a couple years
ago I dream was to get a medical degree
and practice primary health care just
exactly the kind of doctors we need she
is now three hundred thousand dollars in
debt and I thought that was the highest
I was in the morning
number of months ago after a spokeswoman
comes up to me she says well bernie
actually I graduated data school and we
need to get this desperately thousand
dollars in debt just brought to the way
young man
few days ago and it wasn't nearly 90,000
and paying 53 percent of his entire
income back to the government is that
that's pretty crazy stuff so what we
wanted to also has not only made public
colleges and universities tuition-free
we want to lower interest rates on
student debt right now
right now is that you can refinance your
home
what does it cost to refinance a home
near 34 percent
refinance your home with 34 percent and
get your pain
68 10 12 percent interest rates on
student loans that does not make any
sense we're gonna give people the
opportunity to refinance their loans at
the lowest interest rates they can find
I will tell you when they were in
trouble
well now the middle class is in trouble
its wall street's turn to help working
families
now when we talk about but facing the
entire planet it seems to me there is
adults as parents and grandparents we
have got to understand we have to leave
this planet in a way that is healthy and
is habitable our children now I am all
united states and the energy committee
and I thought the scientist not only all
over our country but all over the world
the debate is over climate change is
real it is caused by human activity and
it is already doing devastating to our
country in many parts of the world as
President I will take up the mantle of
having the United States leads the world
working with China Russia India other
countries in transforming our energy
system away from fossil fuel energy
efficiency and sustainable energy and by
the way let me congratulate the people
are because you are one of the leading
states in this country in terms of
moving us toward sustainable energy wind
and biofuels congratulations
i oppose the construction of the box and
piping
energy to invest in energy efficiency
and not become more dependent upon
fossil fuels
hope that everybody understands only
major country on earth
called the United States of America
you've probably heard of that country
that does not guarantee health care to
all people know what that means is that
in the UK Canada France Germany
Scandinavia metals whatever maybe
countries have different healthcare
systems but they are all together they
all have a common goal of guaranteeing
health care to all of their people know
I helped write the Affordable Care Act
among our committee voted for it we got
some good things and I worked out by the
way with your former Senator Tom Harkin
but we still have despite the ACA we
start 29 million people without any
health insurance and even more under
what it means that probably some of you
a very large deductibles or co-payments
am i right on that
talk about the doctor bills
$107,000 how much I was like a model
where you have i mean there are 5,000 is
common person 10,000 per family whatever
it may be and what that means is that
when people get sick and they don't have
a lot of money they hesitate going to be
so what ends up happening there and I've
talked to doctors who said people walk
into their offices and a doctor said 100
company of six months ago and the
persons of wealth health insurance I
didn't have a high deductible sometimes
those people don't like it but sometimes
they end up in a hospital a great
expense to the system and then on top of
that our people paid the highest prices
in the world for prescription drugs
way back when the late nineteen nineties
I took a busload of women from northern
Vermont over the Canadian border and I
did that because many of those women
with breast cancer and they were able to
buy the medicine brand-name medicine
that they needed in Montreal for one
tenth of the price they are paying in
the United States one tenth of the price
and that's probably change but we paid
by far the highest prices in the world
not just like in Canada higher than any
other major country on earth so you will
not be shocked to know the while we pay
the highest prices for prescription
drugs while one out of five Americans
who get a prescription from a doctor
cannot afford to fill that prescription
while elderly people are cutting their
pills in half
because they can't afford to buy what
they need the three major drug companies
in this country last year made 45
billion dollars in profits forty five
billion dollars in parts so one of my
very important goals as president is to
have joined the rest of the
industrialized world guarantee health
care to all people control prescription
drug costs and the best way to do that
is doing Medicare for All single-payer
program
comprehensive health care we also say
middle-class families thousands of
dollars a year on their health care
costs because we pay almost three times
more than the british will provide
healthcare all the people 50 percent
more than the French follower than the
Canadiens so the truth is we cannot
comprehensive universal health care in a
cost effective way if we have the
courage to stand up to the private
insurance companies and the drug to be
just conclude by saying this will open
up to your questions and comments and
that is living in a country we are all
living in which ordinary country but
that over the last thirty years what we
have seen is a massive transfer of
wealth from the middle class to the top
one tenth of one percent The percentage
of wealth of the top one tenth of one
percent now owns has doubled doubled in
the last 30 years not being there I am
talking about this afternoon is
particularly radical everything that I
am talking about
exist in other countries around the
world and virtually everything that I am
talking about you supported by the vast
majority of the American people the
american people want us to raise the
minimum wage for women workers they want
us to rebuild our infrastructure they
want jobs the kids run them put them in
jail they want us to make sure that we
lead the world in addressing climate
change they want all of our people have
health care fees on radical ideas but
what has happened over the last many
years is the United States government
has become more and more separated
from the needs of the middle class and
working families and that has everything
to do with the fact that the government
is now controlled through campaign
donations to a lobbying by a small
number of corporations and very very
wealthy individuals so what this
campaign is about is not just selecting
a person of course I'm here to ask for
your support is to create a political
revolution in which millions of people
many of whom I've given up on the
political process the gym to step up and
say loudly and clearly our government
belongs to all of us and not just a
handful of wealthy campaign contributors
thank you all very much

doing what is a difficult thing to do
and that is to spend considerable
amounts of time and energy trying to
make this country a better place in
which to live and work thank you all
also say to every person in this room
that all our worst we are a hundred
times better than any of the republican
candidates are the best
say a special thanks to the many
thousands of volunteers who have worked
so hard on our campaign
we started this campaign quite fall
behind with your help we have made great
progress and I appreciate all that you
have done
also want to thank the many unions and
organizations too many to name for their
support
many others the Communication Workers of
America United Nurses United and the
American Postal Workers Union Hampshire
State Employees Association
for their support and many other
grassroots organization our campaign has
had a great deal of energy and
enthusiasm and I think the reasons are
pretty obvious we are talking about the
issues let working families and the
middle class are concerned about we are
talking about ending a corrupt campaign
finance system
american democracy is not about Wall
Street and billion as buying elections
american democracy is about one person
one vote that's what the winglet is
about
promise I made to every person in this
arena if elected president no nominee to
the supreme court will get that position
unless he or she is very clear they will
vote to overturn Citizens United
we will address rigged economy that so
many of working people are suffering on
the right now
it is not acceptable to me that at the
same time as we have the highest rate of
childhood poverty of any major country
on earth we also higher income and
wealth inequality that any other major
country on earth to the billionaire
class we are going to create an economy
that works for working families not just
the people on trial
elected president we are going to raise
the minimum wage to a living wage $15
and grace of women make in 79 cents on
the dollar compared to that
and we will pay equity for women workers
in this country
to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure
and create millions of decent paying
jobs trade disastrous trade system and
we are going to tell corporate America
start investing in this country not just
in China
we are going to say that public colleges
and universities should be questioned
three
I want every child in this country
families like mine where my mom and dad
to college I want those kids in
manchester new hampshire early to
understand to understand that if they do
their schoolwork seriously if they do
their homework and have a serious
reasons yes they will be able to get a
college education regardless of the end
of their families
and all of those people in our country
some young and some not so young people
who are now being crushed by
outrageously high levels of student debt
relief is on the way
will give we will give those millions of
people today sometimes paying twenty
twenty-five percent of their income in
student debt we are going to low
interest rates to make your debt more
bearable
senior citizens of New Hampshire many of
whom are trying to get by on eleven
twelve thirteen thousand dollars a year
in social security i understand you
understand that people can not get by on
eleven twelve thirteen thousand dollars
a year
colleagues say we should cut social
security
we should expect and social security
benefits
we are going to light lifting the cap on
taxable income
and the large multinational corporations
who continued to believe that it's okay
for them to put their billions of
dollars in profits in the Cayman Islands
and Bermuda and another tax havens we've
got news for you
going to start paying your fair share of
taxes
on wall street people whose greed and
recklessness this illegal behavior drug
this economy into the worst recession
since the nineteen thirties
bailed out by the middle class of this
country the cost of banks are too big to
fail but today in many cases are bigger
than when we bailed them out we are
going to establish a 21st century glass
six major bugs assets of almost sixty
percent of the GDP of this country
yes we are going to break up
coal industry
charges R Us highest prices in the world
for the medicine we need created a
situation in which one out of five
Americans are unable to buy the medicine
their doctors prescribe we say to them
days of raising prices off the charge
million people who are undocumented
living in the shadows earful about being
deported we say we share your pain and
we are going to pass comprehensive
immigration reform
shamefully shamefully has more people in
jail than any other country on earth we
say there will be real criminal justice
reform
education and jobs for our kids not
jails and it costs erection
we say that we are tired of seeing
people shot down by police
a police officer who breaks the law like
any other public official must be held
accountable
demilitarize local police departments
we must make police departments all
across this country look like the
diversity of the communities they serve
I have been criticized because I believe
all of our people in this great country
are entitled to health care
let me be as clear as I can I confess I
believe that health care is a right of
all people not a privilege
I believe that the Affordable Care Act
which my committee committee upon helped
to write has done some extraordinarily
good things we should be proud of that
we can go further and I believe that we
should move to Medicare for All
single-payer program
leadership is a bow is not just swimming
with the current it's not just coming up
blood
ideas when there is a majority support
for those ideas
before it was fashionable in the early
nineteen nineties congressman Burdick
said oppose nafta and other trade
agreements
corporate America to invest in this
country
create jobs in this country not just in
China
i voted against the so-called Defense of
Marriage Act
and I believe that people have a right
to love whoever they want regardless of
their child
nineteen nineties what all kinds of
people in this country republicans and
yes some Democrats said we should
deregulate Wall Street what a great idea
it would be if commercial banks and
insurance and commercial banks that
invested bags and insurance companies
could merge I didn't think it was such a
good idea
helped lead the opposition to
deregulation
in 2000 and most important debate in
recent history on foreign policy took
place
George W Bush Dick Cheney
they say
it was a good idea to invade Iraq
I listen very carefully to what they
said I didn't believe them I not only
voted against that wall I helped lead
the opposition to that war
standing up and be counted when the
times are rough when you are in a
minority situation also producing the
goods passing legislation that impacts
the people of the Hampshire for a month
and in america of the Veterans Committee
I helped pass the most comprehension of
veterans healthcare legislation passed
in the modern history of this country
not only help millions of veterans all
over this country get better access to
VA health care it was of particular
benefit to the veterans of the state of
New Hampshire
language in the bill that benefit
Hampshire veterans and I I am proud that
is part of the Affordable Care Act
twelve billion dollars in it to expand
community house and North Hampshire and
Vermont and all over this country
past one of the most significant pieces
of environmental legislation putting
billions of dollars to help communities
become less energy efficient and move to
sustainable energy
this no president not Bernie Sanders or
anybody else can bring about the changes
that the middle class and working
families of this country desperately
need and the reason for that is that the
powers that be
Wall Street corporate America the
corporate media the Koch brothers the
large coke campaign don't use so
powerful so powerful that the only way
we create the change that we need is
through a political revolution
millions and millions of people
throughout our country including many
who have given up on the political
process many who think their vote their
voice no longer matters
those people have got to re-engage
politically working people
low-income people young people and with
a loud voice a loud voice
voice heard on Tuesday in the Hampshire
and heard all over this country voice
which says that this couple hours for it
and defended by so many men and women
who prepared to put their lives on the
line this government of ours belongs to
all of us not a handful of wealthy
campaign contributors

apathy enemy is sinister we have the
solution for that please allow me to
introduce to you the next president of
the United States of America so that are
running
how'd you like the pics of history
going
not been done that is put together a
grassroots movement which takes on and
defeat the political and economic
establishment of his country
all over this country not just that
maybe just maybe we have a government
that represents the middle class and
working families rather than building a
corporate America
win just so you know what goes on
politically in this country the rich get
richer everybody else gets coral and
then people get dissolution and they say
you know I can't afford to send my kids
to college or working what are these
guys going on a boat facts are wrong
right answer is we and we change their
own woman born in this country
draw is together to fight for gender the
works for all people
a handful I don't know I don't know what
are trying a little bit strange that is
the wealthiest country in the history of
the world really high rate of childhood
poverty right a little weird well
quality than any other major country on
earth where the top 10 almost as much
well as the bottom 90%
right we've got people were true with
three drawers 50 60 hours a week
get 58 percent of all new income
1 percent right this country we have
more people in jail
proportionately african-american and
Hispanic more people to tell that any
other country order
prior to be maybe it makes more sense
for us to win
education
education rather than jails and it cost
a little bit strange to me that in the
wealthiest nation in the history of the
world which is what we are today we are
the only major country that doesn't
guarantee healthcare go over well as a
right of the trade my Republican
colleagues about family values what
they're really talking about you're
saying that we should not be able to
control their own bodies talking about
talk about their brothers and sisters
should not be able to get buried my wife
and I place
got quarter to seven grandchildren we
have a different set of how about a
United States joins the rest of the
world in case you don't have to live on
a level of $12,000 Social Security maybe
we raised and expand social security
benefits maybe we tell the truck
companies to stop ripping off the
american people
I wanna see this country the most
vibrant democracy in the world I don't
want to see your voter turnouts as we
did a year ago when 63 percent of
Americans vote eighty percent of young
people know that's not what american
democracy should be about voter
suppression we are going to make it
easier for people to not harder and the
other thing that we're gonna do as we
restore real democracy to this country
we're going to overturn this disastrous
citizens united Supreme Court
tell you that we are very few major
presidential campaigns that does not
have a super PAC I don't have a billion
or corporate America and I am immensely
proud to tell you what we have received
more individual campaign contributions
at this point in the campaign that any
campaign in american history
we are running
we are running
president election
works in other words one of the things
that we are talking about I want to the
pictures
high school degree you can take care of
your family today so what seems sensible
is that when we think of public
education we have to expand beyond great
which is why I am fighting
public colleges and universities to we
should three
and why we are also going to
substantially lower interest rates on
student but here's how we're going to
raise money and why I need your help to
make this happen
a speculation acts on Wall Street
happy about this one then when as a
result of the reckless and illegal
behavior you now here I put them to help
the middle class of this country
or look out the window
read your emails listen that's what the
american people want is creating a
political revolution your friends
president if you're interested in
transforming the United States of
America if you're interested in
participating in a political revolution
we need your help thank you

ORGANIZATION.
WE HAD NO MONEY AND WE WERE
TAKING ON THE MOST POWERFUL
POLITICAL ORGANIZATION IN THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

A RECORD-BREAKING VOTER TURNOUT
--
[APPLAUSE]
BECAUSE OF A HUGE VOTER TURNOUT
-- AND I SAY HUGE.
WE WON
BECAUSE WE HARNESSED THE
ENERGY AND THE EXCITEMENT THAT
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WILL NEED

WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN NEW
HAMPSHIRE IN TERMS
OF AN
ENTHUSIASTIC AND AROUSED
ELECTORATE, PEOPLE CAME OUT IN
LARGE NUMBERS, THAT IS WHAT WILL
HAPPEN ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY
.
LET'S NEVER FORGET
THEM --
DEMOCRATS AND PROGRESSIVES WIN

POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC
ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS COUNTRY

UNDERMINING AMERICAN DEMOCRACY
AND WE WILL NOT ACCEPT A RIGGED
ECONOMY IN WHICH ORDINARY
AMERICANS WORK LONGER HOURS FOR
LOWER WAGES WHILE ALMOST ALL NEW
INCOME AND WEALTH GOES TO THE
TOP 1%.
[APPLAUSE]

NOT JUST TO OUR OPPONENTS BUT TO
THOSE WHO SUPPORT ME AS WELL,
THAT WE WILL NEED TO COME
TOGETHER IN A FEW MONTHS AND
UNITE THIS PARTY AND THIS NATION
BECAUSE THE RIGHT WING
REPUBLICANS WE OPPOSE MUST NOT
BE ALLOWED TO GAIN THE
PRESIDENCY.
[APPLAUSE]
AS WE ALL REMEMBER, THE LAST
TIME REPUBLICANS OCCUPIED THE
WHITE HOUSE, THEIR TRICKLE-DOWN
ECONOMIC POLICIES DROVE US INTO
THE WORST ECONOMIC DOWNTURN
SINCE THE DEPRESSION OF THE
1930'S.
NO, WE WILL NOT ALLOW
HUGE TAX
BREAKS FOR BILLIONAIRES.
WE WILL NOT ALLOW
HUGE CUTS TO
SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE,
MEDICAID AND EDUCATION.
[APPLAUSE]
NO, WE WILL NOT ALLOW BACK INTO
THE WHITE HOUSE A POLITICAL
PARTY WHICH IS SO BOLD
EHOLDEN
TO THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY THAT
THEY CANNOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE
SCIENTIFIC REALITY OF CLIMATE
CHANGE.
[APPLAUSE]
THE PEOPLE OF NEW
HAMPSHIRE HAVE
SENT A PROFOUND MESSAGE TO THE
POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT, TO THE
ECONOMIC ESTABLISHMENT AND, BY
THE WAY, THE MEDIA
ESTABLISHMENT.
[APPLAUSE]
BERNIE, BERNIE, BERNIE,
BERNIE, BERNIE.
MR.
SANDERS: WHAT THE PEOPLE
HERE HAVE SAID IS THAT GIVEN THE
ENORMOUS CRISES FACING OUR
COUNTRY, IT IS JUST TOO LATE FOR
THE SAME OLD, SAME OLD
ESTABLISHMENT POLITICS AND
ESTABLISHMENT ECONOMICS.
THE PEOPLE WANT REAL CHANGE.
[APPLAUSE]
WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
SAYING -- BY THE WAY, I HEAR IT
IS NOT JUST FROM PROGRESSIVES
BUT FROM CONSERVATIVES AND FROM
MODERATES, IS THAT WE CAN NO
LONGER CONTINUE TO HAVE A
CAMPAIGN FINANCE SYSTEM IN WHICH
WALL STREET AND THE BILLIONAIRE
CLASS ARE ABLE TO BUY ELECTIONS.
[APPLAUSE]
AMERICANS, AMERICANS NO MATTER
WHAT THEIR POLITICAL VIEW MAY BE
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS NOT WHAT
DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT.
THAT IS WHAT A LA DARK HE IS
ABOUT -- IS ABOUT.
WE WILL NOT ALLOW THAT TO
CONTINUE.
[APPLAUSE]
I DO NOT HAVE A SUPER PAC AND I
DO NOT WANT A SUPER PAC.
[APPLAUSE]
I AM OVERWHELMED AND I AM DEEPLY
MOVED FAR MORE THAN I CAN
EXPRESS IN WORDS BY THE FACT
THAT OUR CAMPAIGN
S'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT COMES FROM
MORE THAN ONE MILLION AMERICANS
WHO HAVE MADE OF MORE THAN $3.7
MILLION
IN INDIVIDUAL
CONTRIBUTIONS.
[APPLAUSE]
THAT IS MORE INDIVIDUAL
CONTRIBUTIONS THAN ANY CANDIDATE
IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED
STATES UP UNTIL THIS POINT IN AN
ELECTION.
[APPLAUSE]
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT AVERAGE
CONTRIBUTION WAS?
$27.
[APPLAUSE]
I AM GOING TO NEW YORK CITY
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW.
BUT, I'M NOT GOING TO NEW YORK
CITY TO HOLD A FUNDRAISER ON
WALL STREET.
INSTEAD, I'M GOING TO
HOLD A
FUNDRAISER RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW
ACROSS AMERICA.
MY REQUEST
IS PLEASE GO TO
BERNIESANDERS.COM AND
CONTRIBUTE.
PLEASE HELP US RAISE THE FUNDS
WE NEED WHETHER IT IS $10 OR
$20

WE NEED TO TAKE THE FIGHT TO
NEVADA, SOUTH CAROLINA
AND THE
STATE ON SUPER TUESDAY.
THERE IT IS.
THAT IS OUR FUNDRAISER.
WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND IS OUR GREAT COUNTRY
WAS BASED ON A SIMPLE PRINCIPLE
AND THAT PRINCIPLE IS FAIRNESS.
LET ME BE VERY
CLEAR -- IT IS
NOT FAIR WHEN WE HAVE MORE
INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY
TODAY THAN ALMOST ANY MAJOR
COUNTRY ON EARTH AND WHEN THE
TOP 1/10 OF 1% NOW OWNS ALMOST
AS MUCH WEALTH AS THE BOTTOM
90%.
THAT IS NOT FAIR.
IT IS NOT FAIR WHEN THE 20TH
WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THIS
COUNTRY NOW OWN MORE WEALTH THAN
THE BOTTOM HALF THAN THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
ARE YOU GUYS READY FOR A RADICAL
IDEA?
TOGETHER, WE ARE GOING TO CREATE
IN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF
US, NOT JUST THE 1%.
[APPLAUSE]
AND WHEN MILLIONS OF OUR PEOPLE
ARE WORKING WITH STARVATION
WAGES, YES, WE ARE GOING TO
RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO $50 AN
HOUR.
-- $15 AN HOUR.
AND WE ARE GOING TO BRING PAY
EQUITY FOR WOMEN.
[APPLAUSE]
AND WHEN WE NEED THE BEST
EDUCATED WORKFORCE IN THE WORLD,
YES, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE PUBLIC
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES
TUITION FREE.
AND FOR THE MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS STRUGGLING WITH
HORRENDOUS LEVELS OF STUDENT
DEBT WE ARE GOING TO EASE THAT
BURDEN.
[APPLAUSE]
IN AMERICA, PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE
FINANCIALLY DISTRESSED FOR
DECADES FOR THE CRIME OF TRYING
TO GET A HIGHER EDUCATION.
THAT IS ABSURD.
MY CRITICS SAY THAT IS A GREAT
IDEA.
YOU ARE INTO THIS GREAT STUFF,
HOW WILL YOU PAY FOR IT?
I WILL TELL YOU HOW.
WE WILL IMPOSE A TAX ON WALL
STREET SPECULATION.
THE
GREED DROVE OUR ECONOMY TO
ITS KNEES.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BAILED OUT
WALL STREET.
NOW IT IS WALL STREET'S TIME TO
HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS
.
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRANSFORMING
AMERICA, IT MEANS
ENDING THAT
HIS OF THIS COUNTRY HAVING MORE
PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN ANY OTHER
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
DISPROPORTIONATELY
AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO.
NOT ONLY ARE WE GOING TO FIGHT
TO END INSTITUTIONAL RACISM
AND
A BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
--
[APPLAUSE]
WE ARE GOING TO
PROVIDE JOBS AND
EDUCATION FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE,
NOT JAILS AND INCARCERATION.
THE DEBATE IS OVER, CLIMATE
CHANGE IS REAL.
IT IS CAUSED BY HUMAN ACTIVITY
AND IT IS ALREADY CAUSING
DEVASTATING PROBLEMS IN THIS
COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD.
WE HAVE A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY
TO WORK WITH COUNTRIES
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO
TRANSFORM OUR ENERGY SYSTEM AWAY
FROM FOSSIL FUELS TO ENERGY
EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABLE
ENERGY.
[APPLAUSE]
NOW I HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED
DURING THIS CAMPAIGN FOR MANY,
MANY THINGS.
EVERY SINGLE
DAY, THAT IS OK,
THAT IS ALL RIGHT.
THEY ARE THROWING EVERYTHING AT
ME EXCEPT THE KITCHEN SINK AND I
HAVE THE FEELING THAT KITCHEN
SINK IS COMING PRETTY SOON AS
WELL.
WHAT ARE CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT IS
THINKING BIG, NOT SMALL.
IT IS ABOUT HAVING THE COURAGE
TO REJECT THE STATUS QUO.
[APPLAUSE]
IT IS ABOUT SAYING THERE IS A
TIME WHEN EVERY MAJOR COUNTRY ON
EARTH DURING TIMES HEALTH CARE
-- GUARANTEES HEALTH CARE TO ALL
OF ITS PEOPLE, WE SHOULD BE
DOING THE SAME IN OUR GREAT
COUNTRY.
IN MY VIEW UNDER PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S LEADERSHIP, BEFORE THE
CARE ACT HAS BEEN -- THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS BEEN AN
IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD, BUT WE
CAN AND MUST DO BETTER.
[APPLAUSE]
29 MILLION AMERICANS SHOULD NOT
REMAIN UNINSURED AND AN EVEN
GREATER NUMBER SHOULD NOT BE
UNDERINSURED WITH LARGE
DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYMENTS.
WE SHOULD NOT BE PAYING
BY FAR
THE HIGHEST PRICES IN THE WORLD
FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS -- LISTEN
TO THIS -- AT A TIME WHEN THE
TOP THREE DRUG COMPANIES IN THIS
COUNTRY MAKE $45 BILLION IN
PROFITS LAST YEAR.
[BOOING]
THAT IS AN OBSCENITY.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING --
WHEN WE MAKE IT TO THE WHITE
HOUSE.
[APPLAUSE]
WHEN WE MAKE IT TO THE WHITE
HOUSE, THE PHARMACEUTICAL
INDUSTRY WILL NOT CONTINUE TO
RIP OFF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
IT MAKES NO SENSE AS A NATION,
WE CONTINUE TO SPEND FAR MORE
PER CAPITAL -- OR CAPITA -- PER
CAPITA THAN ANY
OTHER NATION
THAT GUARANTEES HEALTH CARE TO
ALL OF THEIR PEOPLE AND THAT IS
WHY I BELIEVE IN MEDICARE FOR
ALL SINGLE-PAYER PROGRAMS.
[APPLAUSE]
WHICH WILL NOT ONLY
GUARANTEE
HEALTH CARE FOR ALL, BUT WILL
SAVE THE AVERAGE MIDDLE-CLASS
FAMILY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A
YEAR IN HEALTH CARE COSTS.
[APPLAUSE]
MY FRIENDS, WE ALL
KNOW THAT WE
LIVE IN A DANGEROUS AND COMPLEX
WORLD.
AS PRESIDENT, I WILL DEFEND THIS
NATION BUT I WILL DO IT
RESPONSIBLY.
[APPLAUSE]
I VOTED AGAINST THE WAR IN
IRAQ.
[APPLAUSE]
AND THAT WAS THE RIGHT VOTE.
WHILE WE MUST BE PRESENT --
RELENTLESS IN COMBATING
TERRORISTS WHO WILL DO US HARM,
WE CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT BE THE
POLICEMAN OF THE WORLD.
[APPLAUSE]
NOR SHOULD WE BEAR
THE BURDEN OF
FIGHTING TERRORISM ALONE.
IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THE UNITED
STATES MUST BE PART OF AN
INTERNATIONAL COALITION
SUSTAINED BY NATIONS IN THE
REGION THAT HAVE THE MEANS TO
PROTECT THEMSELVES.
TOGETHER, WE MUST AND WILL
DESTROY ISIS, BUT WE MUST DO IT
IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT PUT OUR
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN THE
MILITARY INTO PERPETUAL WARFARE
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
[APPLAUSE]
MY
FRIENDS, WE MUST FIX OUR
BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT
DIVIDES FAMILIES AND CREATE A
PATH TOWARDS CITIZENSHIP FOR
HARD-WORKING PEOPLE THAT ARE
LIVING IN THE SHADOWS.
[APPLAUSE]
WE MUST STRENGTHEN
AND EXPAND
SOCIAL SECURITY AND INCREASE THE
BENEFITS THAT SENIORS AND
DISABLED VETERANS RECEIVE SO
THAT PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN DIGNITY.
[APPLAUSE]
WE
MUST REBUILD OUR CRUMBLING
INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHEN WE DO
THAT, WE CREATE MILLIONS OF
DECENT PAYING JOBS.
WE MUST PURSUE THE FIGHT FOR
WOMEN'S RIGHTS, GAY RIGHTS, FOR
DISABILITY RIGHTS.
[APPLAUSE]
WE MUST AGAIN STRONGER
OPPOSITION OR CHECK THE RIGHT OF
A WOMAN TO CONTROL HER OWN BODY.
[APPLAUSE]
AND WE MUST PROTECT THE MEN AND
WOMEN WHO SERVE OUR NATION IN
UNIFORM AND PROTECT OUR VETERANS
WHO PUT THEIR LIFE ON THE LINE
TO DEFEND US.
[APPLAUSE]
MY FRIENDS, WE MUST HOLD THE
BILLIONAIRE CLASS AND THE 1%
THAT THEY CANNOT HAVE IT ALL AT
A TIME OF MASSIVE WEALTH AND
INCOME INEQUALITY.
THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE
AND
LARGEST CORPORATIONS IN THIS
COUNTRY WILL START PAYING THEIR
FAIR SHARE OF TAXES.
[APPLAUSE]
MY FRIENDS, I AM THE SON OF A
POLISH IMMIGRANT WHO CAME TO
THIS COUNTRY SPEAKING NO ENGLISH
AND HAVING NO MONEY.
MY FATHER WORKED EVERY DAY OF
HIS LIFE AND HE NEVER MADE A
WHOLE LOT.
MY MOM AND DAD
-- MY BROTHER AND
I GREW UP IN A SMALL
RENT-CONTROLLED APARTMENT IN
BROOKLYN, NEW YORK.
MY MOTHER WHO DIED AT A YOUNG
AGE ALWAYS DREAMED OF MOVING OUT
OF THAT APARTMENT, GETTING A
HOME OF OUR OWN, BUT YOU NEVER
REALIZED THAT DREAM.
THE TRUTH IS NEITHER ONE
COULD
HAVE DREAMED I WOULD BE YEAR

country
number 11
burning
not only
we need people who are working families
and take
with us this evening
we're in telling you what you already
know that as Americans we are appalled
we are disgusted by the attack against
the people of paris by the terrorist
organization and i know i speak for
everyone everyone in our country when we
send our condolences to the families who
lost loved ones and that barbaric attack
in our prayers go out with speedy
recoveries for the many hundreds more
were injured in my view now is the time
for developing serious and effective
strategy now is not the time for cheap
political talk we're trying to take
political advantage of this difficult
moment
now president Obama is trying to do to
unite the world and an organized
campaign against taxes by bringing
together all the country interest in the
international countries countries
president
we will not live in field
I am hearing my Republican colleagues
that I will just say this we will not
succumb to racism
sitcom called
everything but the shorts on their backs
we will not turn our backs on the
refugee
Americans
most importantly we will learn the
lessons of history yesterday the
chairman of the republican national
committee stated and i quote never
before have I seen an american president
President Obama project such weakness on
the global stage end of quote
many of you will remember back in two
thousand and two we had president
president bush
president bush
president but not very spot
dick cheney the whole lot of them they
would talk
and then we should invade Iraq
virtually alone in the result was 6700
brave men and women from our country
hundreds of thousands of people where an
emotional many many Iraqis dead and
wounded in the region that we are paying
the price today for the instability and
that chaos
my Republican colleagues yeah but not
we create a worldwide coalition that
will defeat Isis but no the United
States of America must not be involved
in perpetual war in the Middle East
something else they were closed
including many republicans media who
think that because of this horrific
attack only thing that we should focus
on is the feeding ice and what I say use
yes we will leave the world in defeating
I but at the same time we will rebuild
the disappearing middle class of this
country
and we can accomplish both goals
the campaign that we all know about six
months ago six months ago we began this
campaign with no money no organization
and frankly very few people in Ohio for
the rest of the country
well we have come in six and a half
months
way out over 300,000 people to rallies
like this all over america thousands of
volunteers in every state in this
country when the pundits and the experts
said you know you can't run a serious
political campaign without a super PAC
without raising money from corporations
and millionaires we are doing
proud to tell you that as of today we
have approximately 800,000 Americans
made individual contributions to our
campaign
contribution that any campaign in the
history of america at this point in a
campaign
campaign
money money we don't need
and we're very simply enter the turn
aesthetic few moments ago
very serious problems and the american
people gone that establishment politics
and establishment economics is not going
to solve those problems
understand is that a time when Wall
Street in corporate America and large
campaign donors have so much power
people instinctively understand that no
president not burning send is not
anybody else I'll be enormous problems
that we face the web people know and
what campaign it's not just selecting a
president it is creating a political
revolution
in the last election sixty-three percent
of the American people didn't vote
percent of young people didn't vote vast
majority of low-income working people
didn't vote what our job and it's not an
easy job to reach out to tens of
millions of Americans who are working in
many cases longer hours for low wages
sometimes they can afford to feed their
kids they can't afford to send their
kids to college I would draw is to reach
out to bring people together black and
white Hispanic Asian Americans gay and
straight
country people who immigrated to this
country because we lose we cannot
accomplish that's what
people in this country and when we come
together we can defeat but people with
money
all over this country given a lot of
speeches and one of the best compliments
I've received came from a guy I think
was out on the west coast he said you
know burning what I like about you is
your treating us like we are intelligent
people campaign is about fancy gimmicks
me tell you all kinds of jokes can't do
that are not much of a sense of humor
tell you all about my beautiful family
of my beautiful grandchildren but what I
will do with you which we don't do
enough simply lay on the table
the most serious issues facing our
country
that is what democracy is about
democracy is not what the media thinks
it is it's not a soap opera it's not a
baseball game because of what the polls
are done matter what what democracy is
about presumably is also talking about
the issues that we face respectfully
respectfully arguing about those issues
then coming together to resolve those
couples remember every problem that we
face was caused by human decisions every
problem that we face can be overcome by
better decisions
talking about an issue the talking about
for a very long time and I am happy that
now we are beginning to see more and
more people discuss it and that is the
issue of the grotesque level of income
and wealth inequality that exists in
america today what's going on plain and
simple
in the United States today we have more
income and wealth inequality that almost
any major country on earth and it is
worse today than at any time since 1928
today the extent of the problem today in
America the top one tenth of one percent
1% one-tenth of one percent almost as
much well as the bottom 90%
one but Walton family of Walmart more
wealth than the bottom forty percent of
the American people
in the last two year but fourteen
wealthiest people in this country have
seen their wealth increase by a hundred
and fifty six billion dollars more
wealth is owned in a targeted by the
bottom hundred and thirty million
Americans
in vermont all across this country and I
see it as like crap you got people who
are not working one job of putting out
was working two jobs maybe they're
working three jobs husbands are working
why it wasn't working kids of working
all trying to cobble together the income
they need does the slaying the body
health care put gas in the car to pay
the electric bills and yet today in
America 58% of new income 58% is going
to the top one percent
campaign is simply site is creating an
economy that works for all of us and not
just million head billion
and there's campaign is sending a simple
and straightforward message that the
billionaire place and that is in america
when people the power
billion class will not happen
children go hungry
not continue sending our jobs to China
when millions of people are in desperate
need of good paying work here in America
they will not give huge compensation
packages to the CEOs of large
corporations when they cut the wages and
pensions and health care
and let me just recognize I think some
of the teamster friends
all over this country a promise that was
made to tens of thousands of workers in
guaranteeing them their pensions if you
have anything to say about it and Marcy
Kaptur of Ohio when I do to make sure
that will not be caught
what's going on in america we have to
take a deep breath just take a hard look
at what we see around us
I see I see that today our economy is in
fact better than it was when george bush
left office
something our republican friends we
shouldn't be too hard on them because
they suffer from a very serious illness
called amnesia they could get public in
friends are listening
try to overcome let me remind you of
seven years ago before Obama and Biden
took office
my Republican friends say well you know
we're only going to 250,000 jobs a month
not enough they're right but it's a hell
of a lot better to grow 250,000 jobs
than 200,000 jobs
my Republican colleagues against
suffering from this very seriously they
worry about the deficit not as a serious
problem but they forgot when bush left
office we had a record-breaking one
point four trillion dollar deficit we've
cut that but true
and by the way when bush left office the
American and international financial
system was on the verge of collapse
just in passing we might want to mention
that
the truth is we have made significant
progress in the last seven years against
unprecedented republican obstructionism
on the democratic president and
republican presidents the great middle
class of our country once the envy of
the entire world has in fact been
disappearing despite exploding
technology and increased worker
productivity median family income today
is almost $4,000 less than it was in
1999 and in and the dollars we have
millions of people working men and women
who are earning less money than was the
case thirty or forty years ago that's
the reality
so the question to ask ourselves is how
does it happen that when workers are
producing more because of exploding
technology they are earning less and
working longer hours we are going and
let me tell you something else we talk
about the economy
every month us' government issues a
report on unemployment and what you see
on the front page of the paper thought
official unemployment which actually is
about 5% but what you don't see is that
if you add to that 5% people who have
given up looking for work or people who
are working part time when they want to
work full time real unemployment is
close to 10 percent
that we virtually never discuss and that
is the tragedy of youth unemployment in
this country
I asked him economists' couple of months
ago to do a study for me this is what
they found him listen to this because
this is really very significant what
they fell is that for high school
graduates graduates not dropouts between
the ages of 17 and 24 white kids real
unemployment and underemployment is 33
percent for Hispanic kids 36% for
african-american kids 51% like what kids
want to graduate high school they want
to stand up on their own two feet about
to get out of the house they want to
start earning some money they want to
become independent they want to
slaughter Korea wanna become adults but
when half of the african-american kids
in this country and its cities like
Cleveland that number may even be on
white kids in this country are unable to
stand on their own two feet and get out
and get a decent job bad things begin to
happen
anybody here there is a direct
correlation between outrageously high
youth unemployment and the fact that we
as a nation have more people in jail
than any other country on earth you
would be mistaking
tell you i think is the most common
sense but it's out there and that is
that instead of investing in jails and
cost erection maybe we should invest in
jobs and education
billion dollars a year
blocking our people why don't we take a
fraction of but and use it to create
jobs for young people hanging out on
street corners
heck of a lot less money to send
somebody to the University of Ohio that
put him in jail
right there at the end of my first term
as president the United States of
America will not have more people in
jail than any other country we're going
to have the best in the world
economy brothers and sisters it is not
only the protest level of income and
wealth inequality that's not only
unemployment it is the fact that in your
state and in my state and all over this
country people working longer hours for
low wages and they're working at wages
that do not sustain themselves or their
families and there are people all
working 40 hours a week and then they
have to go to the food shelf in order to
get food to feed their families that
wage earners in america are too damn low
up seven and a quarter an hour here's a
spot wage
in this country
28 living wage 15 bucks and hour over
the next
and when we talk about fair wages I hope
every man he will stand with the women
pay equity for women working
there is no economic reason why women
are making 79 cents on the dollar
compared to men it is sex is not
acceptable
a word about family values you heard
many republicans expressing deep deep
concern
families especially very wealthy
families might contribute to their
campaigns
passionate about unquote family bounds
and everyone here knows what they mean
by family what they mean is that no
woman in America should have the right
to control her own body
and what they mean by family values is
that our gay brothers and sisters should
not have the right to get married I
disagree
senator mixture the early are very
blessed to have great kids and seven
beautiful grandchildren and my wife Jane
and I have been married for 27 years we
believe in family and we believe in
family values but our values just a
little bit different than republican
family guys talk about family values
what I am talking about is ending the
international embarrassment of the
United States of America being the only
major country on earth does not
guarantee hey Family and Medical Leave
it is not a family value to tell a woman
who has just given birth that she has to
be separated a week or two after giving
birth from her baby
has to go back to work and order to earn
the necessary income she needs to
sustain that family could cause there is
no additional income coming under here's
the good news
the good news is that in the congress in
the senate and in the house there is a
very small piece of legislation the
Family and Medical Leave Act we got
nineteen sponsors in the senate
introduced by Senator Gillibrand in the
house we have over a hundred introduced
by congresswoman rosa DeLauro and what
this legislation says of what I strongly
believe is that in America we will
guarantee every family three months of
pay
to those families
third of the income they were and we do
that all the cost of about $1 3800 week
not a bit price to pay a buck 38 a week
my hope is that every candidate for
president especially those who talk
about family values will come on board
and support legislation
when we talk about the economy and when
pollsters go out in the cold
what is on your mind what is on the
minds of the american people always
always always the answer is jobs and the
economy because people understand how
volatile the economy as they understand
that if you up 55 years of age you can
go to work tomorrow and your boss could
say well for thirty years of work joke
but we were facing you with somebody
half your age and half and they
understand that if you're a college
graduate
it is hard to get work commensurate with
your education
high school kid drop out it is hard to
find any work in any way that is why in
my view given unemployment
underemployment the outrageous level
youth unemployment
the federal government must undertake a
massive federal jobs program to put our
people back to work
we should firing teachers and child care
workers
our infrastructure roads bridges water
systems wastewater plants our rail
system our airports all levels and else
in many safe are collapsing we can
create millions of decent paying jobs
rebuilding our infrastructure and output
by the way and let me say this very
clearly to the folks in Ohio when we
talk about jobs it's not only creating
good-paying jobs it is preventing the
loss of good-paying jobs because of
disastrous trade policies
congressman and a senator who proudly
tells you he voted against nafta against
permanent normal trade relations
helped lead the effort to defeat this
disastrous trans-pacific partnership
corporate america likes it or not
they're investing in the United States
of America creating jobs here not just
in China and Vietnam
when we use words like greed and fraud
and dishonesty and allergens these are
just a few of the adjectives we can use
to describe Wall Street
everybody here knows is that the greed
and recklessness and the illegal
behavior on Wall Street pro this country
into the worst economic downturn since
the Great Depression and what happened
is that millions of people jobs found
new jobs many of them lost their homes
and many people lost their life savings
making retirement
much more typical we need banking system
in this country that is part of the
probe dr economy that provides
affordable loans to small and
medium-sized businesses so they can
create jobs
need a banking system in which the 66
largest financial institutions in this
country
assets equivalent to 58 percent of the
GDP of America 6 financial institutions
which issue two-thirds of the credit
cards
one-third of the mortgages when you have
financial institutions and water that
have so much economic power so much
political power during the effort to
deregulate Wall Street which helped lead
the opposition to they spent Wall Street
spent five billion dollars over a
ten-year period on lobbying and campaign
contributions when you have an entity
like water which has so much economic
and political power which is making so
many campaign contributions to super
PACs Democrats and Republicans the
answer to what we have to do is obvious
and that is reestablished glass steagle
break up
financial institutions of Bible Way
three out of the four largest financial
institutions in this country today are
bigger now than they were when we bailed
him out because they were too big to
fail financial institution is too big to
fail it is too big to exist
legislation to take marijuana out of the
controlled substance
number of reasons most importantly over
the last many many years hundreds and
hundreds of thousands of people have
been arrested for possessing marijuana
and they get police records
police record it makes life difficult it
makes it much harder to go out and get a
jet go get a job it makes it harder to
find housing to get the same credit and
in some cases people ended up in jail so
I find it very interesting in terms of a
broken criminal justice system might
find interesting that hundreds of
thousands of people have criminal
records for possessing marijuana but not
one CEO on wall street criminal record
bring major major reforms a broken
criminal justice system we should not be
a country in which we have banks too big
to fail and bankers too big to jail
I am asked you know bernie which
particular issue is the most important I
can never answer them because all of
these issues are so terribly important
but there is one issue which impacts all
other issues and that is five years ago
the Supreme Court in one of the worst
decisions ever made in the history of
the Supreme Court 524 on the Citizens
United case
the wealthiest people in this country
they said guys you already own
much of the economy now we're going to
allow you to purchase United States
government and that is what they are
trying to do right now
very proud to tell you i'ma former
chairman of the USS Senate Committee on
Veterans Affairs we worked very hard to
protect the interests of our veterans
talk to some wonderful people were
fought in World what career in vietnam
only through Iraq and Afghanistan and
these people have put their lives on the
line and of course many of our soldiers
never came home to defend american
democracy american democracy is not
about billionaire's buying elections
a situation where the second wealthiest
families in this country the Koch
brothers in a few of their friends
heard the Koch brothers and spend some
900 million dollars in an election cycle
more money the Democratic or Republican
Party will spend that is not democracy
that is oligarchy and we thought
that I make you know nominee of mine to
the supreme court will get that position
unless he or she is loud and clear in
saying they will vote to overturn
Citizens United
democracy together we are going to stand
up and tell republican governors and
legislators they will not get away with
suppressing the vote
people old people young people that they
cannot vote because
on line for hours in order to exercise
their democratic right to vote we are
going through a constitutional amendment
or some other way we are going to reach
the day went simply and
straightforwardly anybody 18 years of
age or older have the right to vote and
the discussion
don't have the guts to participate in
free and fair elections these cowards
should get another job
in America in which we have not one of
the lowest voter turnout in the
industrialized world but one
to make it easy for people to
participate in the political process not
hard
in a very competitive global economy and
in that context it makes 0 sense to me
that we are hundreds of thousands of
bright and qualified young people who
want to go to college who shot the in
college but can't go to college for one
reason and that is their families lack
the
should be about and that is why I have
introduced legislation and will make
happen its president a process in which
every public college and university in
america is 23
appreciate what that is about telling
every kid in Cleveland and in burlington
vermont that no matter what your income
if you study hard if you do your
schoolwork seriously you will be able to
get a college education
and we are also going to deal with the
outrage of millions of people having
high interest rates on their student
debt
nonsense to be there people are paying
68 10 12 14 percent interest rates on
student debt when you can refinance a
home for three or four percent
people with student that to get the
lowest possible interest rates they can
find
providing the public colleges
universities and lowering student
interest rates an expensive proposition
we are going to pay for that by imposing
a tax on wall street
as a result of their greed and
recklessness crashed they came running
to the congress and begging us to bail
now to help the middle class
when we talk about our responsibilities
as adults as citizens as parents one of
those responsibilities is to make sure
that really future generations a planet
that is healthy and a half
the debate over climate change is real
causing devastating problems and we have
a moral responsibility to work with
countries around the world to transform
our energy system away from fossil fuel
to energy efficiency
and if we do not do that but the
scientists tell us the end of this
century this planet will be up to five
degrees warmer than it is today
more droughts or floods more extreme
weather disturbances we have a moral
responsibility to make sure that does
not happen
and when we talk about where we should
also recognize that today the united
states of america is the only major
country on earth does not guarantee
health care to all people
on the committee that wrote the
Affordable Care Act that we have made
some good progress in this country
through the Affordable Care Act we can
and we must do
29 million people still have health
insurance and many more are underinsured
with large deductibles and co-payments
major country on earth can guarantee
health care to all of their people in a
much more cost effective way than we do
how can the united states of america
can't do that
when we gone through an issue which is
also very much on our minds and ideas as
a nation the understanding that we have
got to put an end to institutional
racism
not just talking about very sick
individuals some months ago for example
walked into a church Bible study class
in Charleston South Carolina just killed
nine people because of the color of
their skin and I'm not talking about and
it was only able to be thinking about
this we have hundreds of organizations
in this country whose sole function is
to push forward
Americans hatred against immigrants
hatred against catholics hatred against
Jews that's what they do but I'm not
just talking about that what I am
talking about is the fact that in this
country we have seen and we've seen much
too often too many african-americans on
all killed by the police when and cost
two other sons are bland and Michael
Brown or a keyboard or called horrible
pretty great arrives
I do not want to read about or see and
you do not want to read about was see
children being shot because they have a
choice gun
continue to see over 100 bullets being
shot into a call
the largest city in the state of Vermont
Burlington Vermont I had the privilege
of working with our police lawmen and
let me tell you what I think most of you
know most police officers are honest and
hardworking and do it very difficult job
many of them are under pain they have
crazy schedules but also very clear and
that is when any police officer any
public official breaks the law that must
be held accountable
tonight no president will work harder
than I and ending institutional racism
in this country and in report for
forming a very very broke in criminal
justice system
a few of the things that have to be done
first thought we have got to
demilitarize our police departments
television local police look like
they're invading the community they are
supposed to be serviced good or good
police department and there are many of
them are part of the community are
trusted by the community on not seen
there's a foreign invading force
that reflect the diversity of the
communities they serve
allowable use Outlaws Late Late is the
last resort not the first one
introduced legislation to do this
of private corporations making profits
by building and running prisons and
detention
drug and medical and mental health
intervention
addiction should be seen as an illness
and treated as such
today from prison to civil society
and when we talk about issues facing our
country I want everybody here not to
forget that there are 11 million people
in this country today who are
undocumented who are living in fear and
living in the shuttle's
people mosque how the rights of legal
status we must pass comprehensive
immigration
and we must follow a path toward
citizenship
hope what I hope that we can do as a
nation and as a people is to think big
not small we are many people don't know
what we today on the wealthiest nation
in the history of the world most people
don't know that because almost all of
the well is resting in the hands of a
few I would say that ever wealthiest
nation in the history of the world with
an enormously productive work with some
great universities and scientists and
teaches there is nothing if we put our
mind that we cannot accomplish don't get
yourself involved in a world view which
says well do we cut education by 2%
raise it by one percent that is not the
dynamic that we should be looking out is
that in the wealthiest country on earth
why is the situation existing in which
every parent to work knows that his or
her kids are in the best quality pre-k
and child care in the world
we can do it tell me why we cannot do
what many other countries do and make
sure that everybody in the country has
the ability of the file is able to get
all of the education regardless of why
can't we do
in this country we have the highest rate
of childhood poverty of almost any major
country on earth though told me we have
to have told me that the united states
that the United States has to be the
only major country not to guarantee
health care to all people provide paid
Family and Medical Leave
United States has to continue having
more income and wealth inequality than
any other major country on earth and how
corporations that make billions but we
end up paying a given year almost
nothing in taxes don't tell me that that
is what country we have to be
that we can have the best health care
system in the world for all about people
to tell me that we can lead the world in
transforming our energy system and
combating climate change
workers in america will not be losing
the patrons they were provided
and people with disabilities
well in fact see an increase in their
social security benefits not a cut
there together we will and racism sexism
but contrary we can create when we come
to go when we stand up and fight back
and when we create a dog that works for
all and not just a handful of billion
revolution

cool
like them hard i would tell everybody to
sit down
whether or not seems like
I'll let me begin to tell you to do so
well my wife we just celebrated not want

we all to age strong saw it
in this had a campaign which is calling
for
a political revolution the
well water and this is
what I mean from the bottom of my heart
also with everything that I believe
intellectually like her jams burning
burning burning I appreciate that
but this is not about bird it really is
about you
and want to talk about a political
revolution what everybody has got on the
stand
is that the do you know class and their
representatives in Washington

Moule serious and here is why
promise to you put this game
not only will I quite to protect the
working families in this country
what we all going bill
a permanent move in this country in
which we are going to standoff
and fight and we're going to do that

more in calm in wealth inequality than
any other major industrialized country

caretakers
all our environment as the people who
enjoy
you all our country and the planet
we on our going while to destroy this
planet
but their short term moments
what are the challenges that we face
huge
unique home is that the american people
want very disillusioned
with the political muscles they are very
demoralized
in the last midterm elections
sixty-three percent
well people didn't bowl he
resigned young people lovable
and all over this country people walk
they're worried about the kids they
worried about their parents
the word about what happens to the win
the gold
and we look to washington and Lisa pay
those people
they're not dealing with the realities
my like and they listen to the EU
television global political gossip all
kinds the ground and not talking about
the realities facing
ordinary Americans media looking at
politics as a war
baseball game was so well rather than
addressing
issues we transform America what we need
to do in my view
you know the with your help and we have
a website which is
going to get better and political Bernie
Sanders like are we want your like to
use we want your feedback as we work
well together but
a sexually what we need to do use create
engine
clear jed me examines the working
families
all this country as to what the
government should be doing
to transform our country. and improve
lives well
what I wanted to know in a few minutes
lil
pretty quickly your I want to watch
online would like
the innocent more be progressive agenda
and the person who
I'll is when you to all the people you
want to be when we do polls
what people would say when you ask them
what is the most important thing on
their minds
it's evil little world more jobs
jobs and the reason they say that is the
No
that unemployment is much too long they
worry about the kids being able to get a
decent job
they were relieved to be there gonna be
label
and not be able to get a job that pays
them have the wages that currently
burning
so in my view weenie
medium rule jobs program
the grease millions a decent paying jobs
and at a time when our infrastructure is
crumbling
10 rules out which is all water systems
always
plans no airport I will I'll let the
user know them million in almost a mile
a word we are not doing as
happened in we believe it is impersonal
and when we do and we make this country
moral
should walk do and sleep well and we can
agree with the $1 trillion dollar
investment
with higher proposed what to order
million
these Jones
you too slowly
marginal greeley jewels which we have to
do
it is a question of saving and preserve
jobs
you are looking at the United States on
who was born again trade agreements like
the
500 after you have to remember the
normal trade relations with China
and I'm gonna help leaders opposition
against the trans-pacific partnership
proved that since 2001
in vermont Minnesota are all over this
country we have more
almost six the thousand factories
and millions of babies and jobs where
you'll
who rolls trade agreement record should
America and the drug companies
and will reminded in with the hollywood
is a great situation with a good shot
down with America
and moved to countries an hour job is
the hell
that we want trade agreements all for
american workers
workers good we would
really jobs in america nachos
good the
and when we more well the economy when
we talk about the economy
let also quickly on that millions of
American workers are working good
what's not much much to wall
middleman federal minimum wage
%uh seven dollars and what the by sites
and I'll
is a stop should we've got a raise
work wage
so you may know the city walls edgewood
recently raised the minimum wage there
15 bucks an hour or more in a few years
exactly
good
for we must stop equity
for women workers the
been built here's a look at some of the
older women doing the same work
his bed make 78 cents on the dollar
that's got changed
and we'll talk respect
working with people of this country know
that every worker in america
as exactly and guarantee
but should
now we deal with an incall in wealth
inequality what we have to understand
is not just well-used people in this
country
in the largest corporations are doing
phenomenally well
what we also have do understand is that
we have
a acts is a global which is written by
these very same people
and it's grossly on there so let me be
very clear
and let me know all the people you know
watching like the vid
if elected he ignored

on this beautiful day
Shwetha wonderful introduction my
message to you all today pretty simple
one and that is our country faces
enormous problems and these problems are
not going to be solved if people turn
away from political struggle of people
throw up their hands and thus parents i
dont wanna get involved it's all crap
you are getting a great education here
in Georgetown and I hope very much you
will learn use what you have learned
here to fight to create a better world
and to follow in the traditions of so
many people for so many years have
struggled to create a more democratic
and just society let me take you now
back to the 1937 and in his inaugural
address in the midst of the Great
Depression President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt looked out at the nation
that's the discoverable depression and
this is what he saw and talked about in
his inaugural
tens of millions of people denied the
basic necessities of life he saw
millions of families trying to live on
incomes so meager that the ball a family
disaster home over them every single day
he saw millions of his fellow Americans
denied education recreation and the
opportunity to better their lot in the
lot of their children he saw millions
lack
the means to buy the products they
needed and Biovail poverty by their lack
of disposable income denying employment
too many other millions because when you
don't have money to spend
you're not creating jobs for other
people he saw one third of a nation in
house Bill Clyde and ill and he acted
against the ferocious opposition of the
ruling class of his day people he called
the economic royalists roosevelt
implemented a series of programs that
put millions of Americans back to work
took them out of dire poverty and
restored their faith in government he
redefined the relationship of the
federal government to the people of our
nation he combat it
citizenM fear and despair he
reinvigorated democracy he transformed
our country and that is exactly what we
have to do today and by the way almost
everything he proposed almost every
program every idea he introduced was
called socialist
I thought I would mention that just in
passing
social security which all of you know
transformed life was senior citizens in
this country was defined by his
opponents as socialist the concept of
the minimum wage that workers had to be
paid at least certain amount of money
for their labor was seen as a radical
intrusion into the marketplace and was
described as socialist unemployment
insurance when you lose your job you
have something to fall back upon
abolishing child labor and the fact that
children of eight ten twelve years of
age were working in factories are
working in the fields the 40 hour work
week collective bargaining the rights of
workers to engage in negotiations with
the union
banking regulations deposit insurance
and job programs that put millions of
people to work for all described in one
way or another as socialist yet as you
all know all of these programs and many
more have become the fabric of our
nation and in fact the foundation of our
middle class thirty years later after
Roosevelt's speech at the nineteen
sixties President Lyndon Johnson 44
medicare and medicaid
to provide health care to millions of
senior citizens and families with
children
persons with disabilities and some of
the most vulnerable people in this
country today medicaid does not seem to
be such a terribly radical idea to save
them when somebody gets old they should
have medical insurance but when it was
proposed once again we're hired
right-wing forces describe these
programs as socialistic and a threat to
the American Way of life that was then
now is now today in the year 2000 in 15
despite the Wall Street Crash of 2008
which drove this country into the worst
economic downturn since the Great
Depression the American people are
clearly better off economically than
they were in 1937 but here is a very
hard truth that we must acknowledge we
must address we must not sweep under the
rock and that is despite a huge increase
in technology and I i was mayor of the
City of Burlington Vermont anybody hear
from Vermont
in the nineteen eighties a radical
development took place we got computers
in city hall nineteen eighties despite a
huge increase in technology and worker
productivity meeting that almost every
worker in america with that technology
is producing a lot more than workers
that came before despite major growth
GDP and a huge increase in the global
economy
hands of millions of American families
continued today to lack the basic
necessities of life while millions more
struggle every day to provide a minimum
standard of living for their families
and I hope none of you will turn your
back on that reality and the truth is
and again this is a truth we must put on
the table yes we are better off today
economically than we were seven years
ago when bush left office but the other
truth is that for the last forty years
or two years on the republican
leadership and democratic leadership the
great middle class of our country has
been in decline and faith in our
political system is now extremely low
new technology increase worker
productivity productivity people work
longer hours for low wages faith in our
political system now extremely low the
very rich get richer almost everyone
else gets super PACs funded by
billionaire has by elections Koch
brothers alone in a few of their friends
will spend more money in this election
cycle than either the Democratic or
Republican Party's
ordinary people working people young
people don't vote we have any economic
and political crisis in this country and
the same old same old politics and
economics will not effectively address
those crises if we are serious about
transforming our country and I hope all
of you are serious about transforming
our country if we are serious about
rebuilding the American middle class if
we are serious about reinvigorating
american democracy we need to develop a
political movement which once again is
prepared to take on and defeat a ruling
class whose greed is destroying our
nation
terms like ruling class probably
Georgetown
and in my view the billionaire class
must be told loudly and clearly that
they cannot have it all our government
belongs to all of us not just a handful
of billionaires
politics and culture which has reminded
us can not just be based on the worship
of money we must not accept a nation in
which billionaire's compete as to the
size of their super yachts while
children in america go hungry and
veterans men and women will put their
lives on the line to defend us sleep out
on the streets today in America we all
the wealthiest nation in the history of
the world but few Americans know that
because so much of the new income and
wealth is going to the people on top in
fact over the last thirty years there
has been a massive redistribution of
wealth problem is it has gone in the
wrong direction
trillion dollars from the hands of
working families and the middle class to
the top one tenth of one percent a
handful of people top one-tenth of one
percent who have seen a doubling of the
percentage of the wealth that they own
during that period doubling of the
percentage wealth they are unbelievably
and grotesquely the top one tenth of one
percent today nearly as much well as the
bottom 90% one-tenth of one percent owns
nearly as much well as the bottom 90%
that is not the kind of america that we
should accept
I can tell you that in my state of
Vermont and all over this country it is
absolutely not uncommon to see people
working two jobs or three jobs the
cobble together the income of the health
care they and their families need in
fact americans work longer hours than do
the people of any other industrialized
country but despite the fact that all
people are working so hard I go around
the country and I see a lot of working
people and you can see the stress and
exhaustion on their faces their work
increasing our husbands hardly see wives
people don't have the quality time for
their kids because the working so hard
just to bring up bringing the income to
survive event despite all of that
despite our people working so hard D
eight percent of all new income
generated today is going to the top one
percent today in america is the middle
class continues to disappear median
family income is 40 $100 less than it
was in 1999 the median male worker made
over $700 less than he did forty two
years ago in inflation-adjusted dollars
you know why people are angry they are
angry because they are working terribly
hard and getting real inflation-adjusted
dollars they are earning less and they
look at all over a nice I'm what's
happening why you stopped but it's not
just last year the media fame female
worker earned more than $1,000 less than
she did in 2000 and seven and 58 percent
of all new income goes to the top one
percent today in America the wealthiest
country in the history of the world
that's what we ought today more than a
half of older workers
have 0 retirement savings think about
that you are 50 55 years of age and
youth we can all right how much to
retire but because my wages have gone
down I have zero in the bank for
retirement and at the same time all over
america you got millions of seniors and
people with disabilities trying to
survive on twelve or thirteen thousand
dollars a year
social security from Ramon California
older workers are scared to death and
they are saying how am I gonna retire
with dignity and i wanna love you can
get your calculators out not now when
you leave you do some arithmetic and try
to put yourself in the place of a senior
citizen in my state of Vermont gets cold
in the winter
trying to supply pump $13,000 a year and
you tell me how you are going to pay for
the food that you need your home and by
the medicine that you need and you know
what you can't do it today in America
nearly 47 million people are living in
poverty and over 20% of our children
including 36 percent of african-american
kids are living in poverty the highest
rate of childhood poverty of almost any
nation on earth and what I want you to
think about is why is it in the
wealthiest country in the history of the
world where we're seeing the
proliferation of millionaires and
billionaires we have the highest rate of
childhood poverty of almost any major
country on Earth today in America 29
million americans have no health
insurance and even more are underinsured
with outrageously high co-payments and
deductibles in other words people do
have insurance but I talk to people
every day I got a $5,000 deductible
8,000 although they can't go to the
doctor when they need and then on top of
that for a wide variety of reasons our
people pay the highest prices in the
world for prescription drugs and doctors
tell me all of the time we prescribe
something I medicine for all patients
they can't afford to fill that medicine
that prescription one out of five
Americans cannot afford to fill the
prescriptions their doctors right what
insanity is that today in America youth
unemployment and underemployment is over
35% for african-american kids it is over
50% meanwhile we have more people in
jail than any other country China
communist authoritarian country four
times our size we have more people in
jail than China and countless lives are
being destroyed as we spend eighty
billion dollars a year
locking up our fellow Americans the
bottom line is that today in America we
not only have massive wealth and income
inequality but a power structure built
around that inequality which protects
those who have the money today a handful
of super-wealthy campaign contributors
have enormous influence over the
political process while their lobbyists
determine much of what goes on in
congress and any member of the United
States House or Senate
who is prepared to tell you the truth
will tell you exactly that now in 1944
in his State of the Union speech
President Roosevelt outlined what he
called a second bill of rights are all
familiar with our bill arrives and what
roosevelt outline was what he called a
second bill of rights
this is in my view one of the more
importance pitchers ever made by a
president but unfortunately it has not
gotten the attention that it deserves so
I'm gonna give it some attention today
in his remarkable speech this is what
roosevelt stated and i quote we have
come to a clear realization of the fact
that true individual freedom cannot
exist without economic security and
independence just sensitive men and we
would add women are not free men and
women and of course in other words real
freedom must include economic security
that was roosevelt's vision seventy
years ago it is my vision today it is a
vision that we have not yet achieved and
it is time that we did
in that speech roosevelt described
economic rights are I G H T S writes
that he believed every american was
entitled to the right to a decent job at
the same page the right to adequate food
clothing and time off from work
the right for every business large and
small to function in an atmosphere free
from unfair competition and domination
by monopolies the right of all Americans
to have a decent home and decent health
care what roosevelt was stating in 1944
what martin luther king junior stated in
similar terms twenty years later and
what I believe today is that true
freedom does not occur without economic
security people are not free
they are not truly free when they are
unable to feed their family they are not
truly free when they are unable to
retire with dignity they are not truly
free when they are unemployed
underemployed or when they are exhausted
by working 60 70 hours a week people are
not truly free when they don't know how
they're going to get medical help when
they or a family member are sick so let
me take this opportunity to to find for
you simply and straightforwardly what
democratic socialism means to me it
means building on what franklin delano
roosevelt said when he fought for
guaranteed economic rights for all
americans and it builds on what martin
luther king junior said in 1968 when he
stated and i quote this country has
socialism for the rich and rugged
individualism for the pool and of course
few democratic socialism builds on the
success of many other countries around
the world who have done a far better job
than we have in protecting the deeds of
their working families they are elderly
citizens their children they are sick
and their pool democratic socialism
means that we must reform political
system which is corrupt that we must
create an economy that works law not
just the very wealthy democratic
socialism to my mind speaks to a system
which for example during the nineteen
eighties and I want you to hear this
allowed Wall Street to spend by billion
dollars over a ten-year period in
lobbying and campaign contributions in
order to get deregulated they wanted the
government of their backs they wanted to
do whatever they wanted to do
spent five billion dollars over a
ten-year period on lobbying and campaign
contributions then ten years later after
their greed and recklessness and illegal
behavior led to their collapse
what our system enables them to do is to
get bailed out by the United States
government which through Congress and
the Fed provided trillions of dollars in
aid to wall street in other words
wall street use their wealth and power
to get Congress to do their bidding for
deregulation and then when Wall Street
collapse they use their wealth and power
to get bailed out quite a system and
then to add insult to injury we were
told that not only were the banks too
big to fail we were told that the
bankers were too big to jail
this is the system young people who get
caught possessing marijuana they get
police records and many many hundreds of
thousands of them have received police
records which have impacted they live in
very serious ways on the other hand Wall
Street CEOs who helped destroy the
economy they don't get police records
they get raises in their salaries and
this is what dr. Martin Luther King jr.
meant when he talked about socialism for
the rich and rugged individualism for
everyone else in my view it is time we
had democratic socialism for working
families doctors for Wall Street
billionaires and large corporations it
means that we should not be providing
well fail for corporations it means that
we should not be providing huge tax
breaks for the wealthiest people in this
country or trade policies which boost
corporate profits while they result in
workers losing their jobs it means that
we create a government works works for
all of the american people not just
powerful special interests it means that
economic rights must be an essential
part of what America stands for among
many other things it means that health
care should be a right of all people not
a privilege
I know there are some people out there
wasn't this is just a incredibly radical
I imagine in the United States of
America all of us having health care is
a right but I hope all of you know this
is not a radical idea it is a
conservative idea it is an idea and a
practice that exists in every major
country on earth you know not just in
Scandinavia Denmark Sweden Norway it
exists in Canada I live fifty miles away
from Canada France Germany Taiwan all
over the world countries have made the
determination that all of their people
are entitled to health care and I
believe the time is long overdue for the
United States to join the rest of the
world
for all single-payer program which i
support would not only guarantee health
care for people not only save
middle-class families and our entire
nation significant sums of money because
all of you should know that our health
care system is by far the most expensive
per capita of any system on earth but a
Medicare for All single-payer program
would radically improve the lives of all
Americans and bring about significant
improvements in our economy
think about it people who get sick will
not have to worry about paying a
deductible or making a co-payment
radical idea when they are sick they can
actually go to the doctor and not end up
in the emergency room at a much greater
expense to the system
think about it business owners will not
have to spend enormous amounts of time
worrying about how they're going to
provide health care for their employees
think about it and we don't talk about
this very much you got millions of
workers in this country who are staying
on Jobs in jobs which they do not want
to stay in but they are there because
they have a decent health care program
for themselves and their families think
what it means when young people are
anybody else can sell you a lot this is
the job of this is what I want to do and
I'm gonna do this work and I don't have
to worry about health care because all
of us in america have health care
and by the way what a Medicare for All
system will bring about is ending the
absurdity of the american people paying
by fall the highest prices in the world
for prescription drugs now when I talk
about democratic socialism what that
means to me is that in the year two
thousand and 15 a college degree today
is equivalent to what a high school
degree was fifty years ago and what that
means is that public education must
today
allow every person in this country who
have has the ability the qualifications
and the desire the right to go to a
public college or university tuition
free
radical socialistic idea I don't think
so
it exists in many countries all over the
world and you know what used to exist in
the united states of america we are
great universities like University of
California the City University of New
York virtually tuition free democratic
socialism means that our government does
everything it can to create a full
employment economy it makes far more
sense to me to put millions of people
back to work rebuilding our crumbling
infrastructure then to have a real
unemployment rate of almost 10% it is
far smaller to invest in jobs and
educational opportunities for young
people who are unemployed then to lock
them up and invest in jails and
incarceration
products socialism means that a somebody
works 40 hours a week that person should
not be living in poverty that we must
raise the minimum wage to a living wage
15 bucks a towel over the next several
years
it means that we join the rest of the
world and pass the very strong paid
Family and Medical Leave legislation now
sitting in congress
think about this want you to see what
goes on in our country today it's not
only that every other major country
virtually every country in the world
poor countries country reached the
conclusion that when a woman has a baby
she should not be forced to be separated
from that newborn baby after a week or
two and have to go back to work making
sure that moms and dads can stay home
and get to love their babies is a family
value that we should support and that is
why I want and will fight to end the
absurdity of the United States being one
of the only countries on earth that does
not guarantee at least three months of
paid Family and Medical Leave
democratic socialism to me means that we
have government policy
strong government policy which does not
allow the greed and profiteering of the
fossil fuel industry to destroy our
environment and our planet
and it means today that we have a moral
responsibility to combat climate change
and leave this planet healthy and
habitable for our kids and our
grandchildren
democratic socialism beings that in a
democratic civilised society the
wealthiest people in the largest
corporations must pay their fair share
of taxes
yes innovation entrepreneurial ship and
business success should be rewarded by
greed for the sake of greed is not
something that public policy should
support
it is not acceptable to me that in the
last period of time last two years
fifteen of the wealthiest people in this
country fifteen people saw their wealth
increase in this room economy by a
hundred and seventy billion dollars got
it two years fifteen people a hundred
and seventy billion dollars increase in
there well that is more wealth than is
owned by the bottom one hundred and
thirty million Americans let us not
forget what Pope Francis has so
elegantly stated and i quote we have
created new idols the worship of the
Golden Calf of old has found a new and
thoughtless image in the cult of money
and the dictatorship of an economy which
is faceless and lacking any truly you
main goal and the other works
we've got to do better than that not a
political issue it's not an economic
issue it is a cultural issue we have got
to stop worshiping people make billions
and billions and billions of dollars
while we have the highest rate of
childhood poverty of any major country
is not acceptable to me that major
corporations stashed their profits in
the Cayman Islands and other tax havens
to avoid paying one hundred billion
dollars a year in taxes it is not
acceptable that hedge fund managers pay
a lower effective tax rate for nurses or
truck drivers it is not acceptable that
billionaire families are able to leave
virtually all of their wealth to their
families without paying a reasonable
estate tax it is not acceptable that
Wall Street speculators are able
to gamble trillions of dollars in the
derivatives market without paying a
nickel in taxes on that speculation
democratic socialism to me does not just
mean that we must create a nation of
economic and social justice and
environmental Saturday of course it does
mean that but it also means that we must
create a vibrant democracy based on the
principle of one person one vote it is
extremely safe and I hope all of you
will pay a lot of attention to this
issue it is extremely sad that the
United States one of the oldest most
stable democracies in the world has one
of the lowest voter turnout of any major
country and that millions of young
people and working people have given up
on the political process entirely in the
last midterm election just a year ago
sixty-three percent of the American
people didn't vote eighty percent of
young people did not vote clearly
despite the efforts of many republican
governors who want to suppress the vote
to make it harder for people of color in
old people to participate in the
political system our job together is to
make it easier for people to vote not
hard for people to the
it is not a radical idea and I will
fight for this as hard as I can as
president to say that everyone in this
country who was 18 years of age or older
is registered to vote
end of discussion
so the next time that you hear be
attacked as a socialist like tomorrow
remember this I don't believe government
should take over the grocery store down
the street
production but I do believe that the
middle class and the working families of
this country who produce the wealth of
this country deserve a decent standard
of living and that their incomes should
go up not down I do believe in private
companies that thrive and invest and
grow in america companies that create
jobs here rather than companies that are
shutting down in america and increasing
their profits by exploiting low-wage
labor abroad
I believe that most Americans can pay
lower taxes if hedge fund managers who
make billions manipulating the market
place finally start paying the taxes
that they should I don't believe in
special treatment for the top one
percent but I do believe in equal
treatment for african-americans who are
right to proclaim the moral principle
that black lives
metal
I despise appeals to nativism and
Prejudice a lot of which we have been
hearing in recent months and I do
probably believe in immigration reform
a pathway to citizenship and a better
life
while subject let me just say real world
of concern to what I've been hearing
from some Republican candidates for
president in recent months people can
have honest disagreements about
immigration or anything else
democracy but people should not be using
the political process to inject racism
into the debate
Donald Trump and others referred to
latinos as people from mexico is
criminals and rapists if they want to
open that door our job is to shut that
door and shut it tight
this country has gone to fall too many
people have suffered too many people
have died for us to continue during
races words coming from major political
leaders now I don't believe in some
foreign is but I do believe in american
idealism and one of the pleasures of
experience on this campaign so far being
here today with you
the country huge numbers of young people
were coming
want to make this country better want to
use their intelligence in their energy
to address the many problems that we
have so I want to thank all of the young
people
country idealism do not become I am NOT
running for president because it is my
turn I was born in a three and a half
will apartment in a working-class family
in Brooklyn New York I don't think
by the way I visited California and
seriousness it is quite my turn that's
not why I'm running for president but I
am running for president in order for
all of us to be able to live in a nation
of hope and opportunity not for some but
for my seven grandchildren and for all
of you
nobody understood the connection between
american strength at home and our
ability to defend america around the
world and that is why he proposed a
second bill of rights in 1944 up any
said in that very same state of the
union and I quote again america's own
rightful place in the world depends in
large part upon health fully these and
similar rights have been carried into
practice for all our citizens for unless
there is security here at home there
cannot be lasting peace lasting peace in
the world and I am NOT running for
president
to pursue reckless adventures abroad but
to rebuild america's strength at home I
will never hesitate to defend this
nation but I will never send our sons
and daughters to war under false
pretense or pre cancers about dubious
battles with no end in sight
and as we discuss foreign policy I know
that all of you share with me your shock
horror at what happened in Paris and you
share with me your condolences to the
families who lost loved ones in your
hopes and prayers that those who were
wounded will recover and also those same
thoughts go out to the families of those
who lost loved ones in the russian like
that we believe I was taken down by
indices bomb and also those who lost
their lives to terrorist attacks in
lebanon and elsewhere to my mind it is
clear that the United States must pursue
policies to destroy the brutal and to
create conditions that prevent fanatical
extremist ideologies from flourishing
but we cannot and should not do it alone
our response must begin with an
understanding of past mistakes and
missteps in our previous approaches to
foreign policy it begins with the
acknowledgement that unilateral military
action should be a last resort not a
first resort
and ill-conceived military decisions
such as the invasion of Iraq can wreak
far-reaching devastation and
destabilization over regions for decades
that the found policy decisions of the
past
russia into war regime change in Iraq
war toppling Mohammad Mossadegh in I ran
in 1953 was the president CIA and others
got rid of them to protect British
Petroleum interests the Shah of Iran's
came in a brutal dictator and he was
thrown out by the Islamic Revolution and
that is where we are and I ran today
decisions have consequences orphan
unintended consequences so whether it
was saddam hussein
attack or Guatemalan President events in
1954 Guatemalan Brazilian President
galore in 1964 Chilean President
Salvador Allende in 1973 this type of
regime change this type of throwing
overthrowing governments we may not like
all thing does not work often makes a
bad and difficult decision even worse
these are lessons we must learn
after World War 2 ww2 in response to the
fear of soviet aggression European
nations and the United States
established nato the north american
Treaty Organization an organization
based on shared interests and goals and
the notion of a collective defense
against a common enemy it is my belief
that we must expand on these ideals and
solidify our commitments to work
together to combat the global threat of
terror we must create a new organization
like nato to confront the security
threats of the 21st century and
organization that emphasizes cooperation
and collaboration to defeat the rise of
violent extremism any importantly to
address the root causes on the line
these brutal acts we must work with our
nato partners we must work to expand the
coalition with russia and we must work
with members of the Arab League but let
us be very clear while the United States
and other Western nations how bush
strength of our military and our
political system's the fight against
Isis is a struggle for the soul of Islam
and countering violent extremism and
destroying Isis must be drawn primarily
by Muslim nations with the strong
support of their global partners
long before Paris but I am very happy to
tell you that these same sentiments have
been echoed by people like Jordan's King
Abdullah the second in a speech just
Sunday in which he said that terrorism
is the greatest threat to our region the
gulf region Middle East and that Muslims
must lead the fight against he noted
that confronting extremism is both a
regional and international
responsibilities and that it is
incumbent on Muslim nations and
communities to confront those who seek
to hijack their societies and their
religion with generations of intolerance
and violent ideology and let me
congratulate King Abdullah not only for
his wise remarks but also for the role
that his small country is playing only
for his wise remarks but also for the
role that his small country is playing
in attempting to address the horrific to
combat Isis
to seal the borders that fighters are
currently flowing across to share
counterterrorism intelligence to turn
off the spigot of terrorist financing
end-to-end support for exploiting
extremist ideologies and what does that
mean what it means is that in many cases
we must ask more from those countries in
the Gulf region while Jordan Turkey
Egypt and Lebanon in their own ways have
accepted their responsibilities for
taking in Syrian refugees other
countries in the region have done
nothing or very little equally important
and this is a point that may make some
people uncomfortable but it is a client
that must be made countries in the
region like Saudi Arabia Kuwait Qatar
the UAE countries of enormous wealth and
resources have contributed far too
little in the fight against Isis that
must change
absolutely right when he says the Muslim
nations must lead the fight against and
that includes and must include some of
the most wealthy and powerful nations in
the region to this point have done too
little Saudi Arabia turns out has the
third largest defense budget in the
world yet instead of fighting I says
they are focused more on a campaign to
oust I ran back hootie rebels in Yemen
Kuwait a country whose ruling family was
restored to power by the United States
driving saddam hussein's iraq out of
kuwait has been a well-known kuwait
people in kuwait have been well known
sources of financing for Isis and other
violent extremists it has been reported
the cutoff will spend up to two hundred
billion dollars on the 2000 and 22 World
Cup including the construction of an
enormous number of facilities to host
that event 200 billion on hosting a
soccer event yet very little to fight
Isis were still it has been widely
reported that the government there has
not been vigilant in stemming the flow
of terrorist financing and the Qatari
individuals and organizations funnel
money to some of the most extreme
terrorist groups in the region all this
has got to change
wealthy and powerful Muslim nations in
the region can no longer sit on the
sidelines and expect the United States
our young men in
women and our taxpayers to do it for
them they have got to come up to the
plate
as we develop a strongly coordinated
effort we need a commitment from these
countries that the fight against Isis
takes precedence over the religious and
ideological differences that handful the
kind of cooperation that we desperately
need further we all understand that
Bashar al-assad president of syria is a
brutal dictator who has lauded many of
his own people I am pleased that we saw
last weekend
diplomats from all over the world known
as the International serious support
group set a timetable for a syrian-led
political transition with an open and
fair election these are the promising
beginnings of a collective effort to end
the bloodshed and move toward a
political transition in Syria the double
up diplomatic plan for Assad transition
from paula is a good step in a united
front but our major priority must be to
defeat Isis nations all over the world
who share a common interest in
protecting themselves against
international terrorism must make the
destruction of Isis the highest priority
nations in the region must admit that
instead of turning a blind eye they will
commit their resources to preventing the
free flow of terrorists financials and
fighters to Syria and Iraq we need a
commitment that they will count the
violent rhetoric that fuels terrorism
river that often occurs within their
borders
this is the model which we must pursue
in order to address the global threats
that we face while individual donations
obviously have historic dispute the
united states and russia now very strong
differences of opinion on some very
serious issues I ran in saudi arabia to
put it mildly
do not like each other but the time is
now to do everything possible to put
aside those differences to work toward a
common goal of destroying Isis sadly as
we have seen recently no country is
immune from attacks by the violent
organization called Isis does we must
work with our partners in europe the
Gulf region Africa and Southeast Asia
all along the way
asking the hard questions whether their
actions are serving how unified purpose
the bottom line is that I says must be
destroyed but it cannot be defeated by
the United States alone a new and
effective coalition must be formed with
the Muslim nations leading the effort on
the ground while the United States and
other major forces provide the support
they need
let me conclude once again thanking all
of you for being here today all across
this country is elimination from the
political process people look to
washington and they throw their hands up
and they say what in God's name is going
on there why you are into our senators
and congressmen paying attention to our
needs why are we developing a rational
farm policy rather than talking again
about getting involved in the Middle
East which could lead to perpetual
conclude just by saying this the
problems that we face as a nation are
indeed very very serious like talk talk
talk on some there's a lot we haven't
even touched upon but by in large
all of these problems were caused by bad
human decisions if we come together if
we stand together if we do not allow
ourselves to be divided up by race by
whether we gave weather wish rate was
born in America we weren't born in
america whether a male or female if we
stand together and if we focus on how we
can create same foreign policy how we
can rebuild the middle class how we can
combat climate change how we can create
a nation in which we end racism and
homophobia if we are prepared to do that
if you as young people are prepared to
engage in the political process I have
no doubt that there is nothing nothing
nothing that together we cannot
accomplish thank you all very much

their special claim to fame with not
just that they produced a fantastic
ice cream and dozens of weird flavors
but that they were also great

jerry's show the world that one could be
a successful
and profitable company while at the same
time maintaining progressive
ideals in recent years enduring have
been increasingly concerned
about the power of big money in politics
and what it's doing to our democracy
please welcome back Cohen and Jerry
Greenfield
%uh
the
the
the one
and honor Ford van and me to be here
supporting Bernie Sanders a man who for
all over
thirty years has been fighting for
fairness
and against injustice and I feel so
lucky
and millions of Americans
across the country are lucky that we can
now
join bernie in this fight the
you know
front-runner business as usual politics
from either party is just more of the
same
more money for the ultra-wealthy and
nice for everybody else
more profits for oil companies and less
clean air debris
more money for jails and defense
contractors
and pharmaceutical companies and less
money for schools
lifting people out of poverty and
creating a healthier society
both physically and spiritually
this system isn't broken it fixed
it's great it's no accident
that corporate profits through through
the room while wages are stagnant
it's no accident that ninety percent of
the wealth created in the last five
years
has gone to the top one percent the laws
are written by politicians
to please the corporations and the
ultra-wealthy
who bought those politicians with
millions of dollars
up so-called political campaign
contributions
otherwise known as legalized bribery
the and Bernie s led the fight to put an
end to it
unlike some johnny-come-lately stew the
issues
bernie is the real thing %uh
he's not about reading the polls and
figuring out what he needs to say in
order to get elected
he said now and unwavering commitment
to basic Justice a quality and sound
financial sets
the
I mean the guys been saying and doing
the same stuff for the last thirty years
in
if he weren't so inspiring he'd be
pouring he's about leading with his
heart and his soul
and using his brain to do what's best
for the little guy
the guy who is ignored by the political
elite
until it's time to ask for their book
you know some say that voting for Bernie
is throwing your vote away %uh
I they say that voting for anyone else
is flushing our country down the drain
%uh
the the
and you know sometimes the underdog
links
in the early days depending Jerry
when we were barely available outside
firm are
the pillsbury corporation owners have
Haagen Dazs
were illegally trying to put us out of
business
we couldn't afford to fight them in
court
but we took our case to the people
an appeal to their sense of fairness and
one
%uh and the country found out what the
Doughboy I was afraid
this is a guy with the
vision and that got sent the smarts to
return America to what made our country
great
in the first place for those who have
been sitting on the sidelines
finally a candidate worth voting for
the
and you know what if we all get all of
our butts
and work for any bernie will def by
the experts once again and he'll wear
the
the
you know in the end there's a spiritual
dimension to all this
as Tracy Chapman saying hunger for a
tasty justice
hunger only for a world that truth
costs all that you have is your sole
so let this be the start
up the Bernie rebellion the
a rebellion against big money in
politics that has corrupted our
government a rebellion against
inequality and shoving marginalize
people
aside a REIT billion against democracy
in name only
and a return to government

world

any time since the Great Depression
and if you include the planetary crisis
up climate change it may well be that
the challenges we face now
are more dire than at any time in the
modern history
of our country and here is my promise

directly to the people in town meetings
daughter door conversations on street
corners
and its social media the
this week we're gonna be in new
hampshire

be in Minnesota
and that is just a thought August archer
okay
%uh out
let me be clear this campaign
is not about Bernie Sanders it's not
about hillary Clinton it is not about
jeb bush or anyone else this campaign
is about but needs of the american
people
%uh
and the ideas and proposals
that up effectively addressed does the
as someone who has never run
a naked up political ad in my life
%uh
my campaign will not be driven
white political gossip or reckless
personal attacks out
this is wat the American people
wat and deserved these are serious times
weenie serious debates %uh
politics
in a democratic society should not be
treated
as if it were a baseball game
eight-game gameshow or a salt
opera and I hope to me dr
understand side as well %uh
let me take a minute
to touch on some of the issues then I
will be focusing on in the coming month
and then give you a brief outline
arbitrage and up for
America up and agenda which in fact
will deal with the serious problems and
lead us
to a better future today
today we live in a nation which is the
wealthiest nation in the history of the
world
what got reality means very little
for most robust because almost all of
that wealth
is owned and controlled by a tiny
handful of individuals in america
we now have wat income and wealth
inequality
than any other major country on earth
and the gap between
not very rich should everyone else if
growing
wider NY the airshow
while and income inequality is for great
moral issue of our time it is for
greater economic issue
of our time it is for great political
issue
all about I'm and we well address it
%uh
and
like me
be very clear and let the clock
1 percent understand this there is
something profoundly wrong
when the top 110 up 1 percent
owns own both of us much well ever
bottom ninety percent
and when ninety-nine percent all
no income go through the top what
percent
there is something profoundly wrong
where in recent years we have seen a
proliferation of millionaires
and billionaires at the same time X
millions of Americans
are working longer hours polo wagers
and we have shamefully the highest rate
our childhood poverty of any major
country
there is something profoundly wrong
went 1 family one family
all swallow wealth in this country than
the bottom
130 million Americans
this grotesque level
update equality is the moral it is bad
economics
it is unsustainable this type of
wreck the economy if not what america
is supposed to be about this has got to
change
and as your president took cab up we are
going to change it
one it's not just
income and wealth inequality it is a
tragic reality
that for the last forty years great
middle-class
about country 13 NV up the entire world
has been disappearing despite
exploding technology and increased
worker productivity
median family income is almost five
thousand dollars less today
that it was in 1999 in our great state
and all over this country people are
working not one drop
but to drop three jobs trying to cobble
together
any car and some healthcare back is not
acceptable we can inbox do better
the truth there's the real unemployment
is not
5.4 percent what you read in the papers
it is close to 11 percent youth
unemployment seventy percent
african-american youth unemployment
of but rocks today
shamefully we are 45 million people
living in poverty
many of whom are working and low-wage
job in america today despite the gains
of the Affordable Care Act 35 million
Americans
still lack any help injured my friends
diana is the reality
upper-middle-class in america today
and not is a reality not just for our
what for our kids and our grandchildren
that we
are going to change
my fellow americans love me as
want be as blunt as I can and tell you
what you already know
as a result other disastrous Supreme
Court decision
I'm citizens united the American
political system
has been totally corrupted and the
foundations of American democracy
on now being undermine what the supreme
court said
sexually was that it was not good enough
with the billionaires own March up the
economy
they could now all the United States
government
as well and that is precisely what
they are trying to do
now when I learned in school and I they
quickly many women who put their lives
on the line to defend our country
have long know that american democracy
is not about billionaires
being able to buy candidates and by
election
it is thought about the Koch brothers
Sheldon Adelson
and other incredibly wealthy individuals
spending billions of dollars
to elect candidates who will make the
rich richer
and everyone else poor according to
media reports that you can't believe it
the Koch brothers in this election cycle
are prepared to spend more money but I
believe the Democratic
or Republican Party's that is not
democracy
that is oligarchy
in vermont throughout town meetings we
know what democracy is about that as one
person
one-vote and not for karnal political
system
we are going to fight law and are going
to achieve
now when we talk about
our responsibilities as human beings
that as per
there's nothing more important leaving
this country and the entire planet
in a way that is habitable for our kids
and our grandchildren
but the bay is over scientific community
has spoken
in a virtually unanimous boys climate
change is real
it is caused by human activity and is
already causing
devastating problems in our country and
around the world and let's be clear
if we do not get our act together
and happy United slates leave the world
in combat in climate change there will
be a boy drowned more
famine more rising sea level wat wud
warm ocean acidification more
extreme weather disturbances airs
human being will work out all well
this environment who appreciate
the beauty that we have on this planet
we are not going to allow
a fossil fuel industry the Detroit
their line
out
brothers and sisters it is no secret
that there is massive discontent with
politics in america today
in the last picture malek should some 63
percent of Americans
did not bowl including eighty percent
young people
poll after poll tells of that all
citizens no longer have confidence
in our political institutions and given
the power a big-money
in the political process in general they
understand
that their pain is not being
heard washing and that people in
washington
elected official much wat concern about
the lobbyists
and the billionaire the suffering
ordinary
now combat ng this political
alienation this it is and this
legitimate
angle will not be easy that's for sure
but that is exactly
what gavel we machst du
if we're going to turn this country
around
and that is what this campaign is all
about
and if we are going to bring people
together
we need a simple straightforward
progressive agenda which speaks to the
need
up the American people and provide
software
a vision are they very different America
and what his father John let me briefly
tell you when I think the agenda begins
with
job job and more jobs if we are serious
about reversing the client the middle
class
we need a may drop federal jobs program
which put millions of people back to
work
a good paying jobs at a time when our
roads our bridges
our water system rail and airport of the
caning
about the fact that way to rapidly
create
meaningful jobs is to rebuild our
crumbling
infrastructure
and that is why I
introduce legislation which would at
best one trillion dollars over five
years
to modernize our country's physical
infrastructure of legislation that would
create
and maintain third she million
good-paying jobs
and if you're president
I will lead the effort to make sure what
that legislation
this past I will also continue to oppose
our current trade policy what de que
presidents from both parties have
supported trade agreements which are
poor start
million up decent paying jobs as
corporate america
shot down plants in vermont throughout
this country
and moves to low-wage country as
president might trade policies
will break not cycle of agreements which
rich
but few at the expense up too many
lot of also be on earth
and acknowledge that today million
of american workers on now working poor
totally
inadequate wages the car in
federal minimum wage up seven and a
quarter now are
is a start they should wage and Mark be
raised
not minimum wage in this country
marked b.com a living wage which be
which believes raising it the fifteen
dollars an hour
over the next few years old
our goal
not a radical idea when our goal must be
that any worker
in this country who worked 40 hours a
week
is not living in poverty Burgaw
we must stop large pay equity for women
workers
it is unconscionable that women earn 78
cents on the dollar
compared to men will perform the same
work
we must also revived our
overtime standards so that people
people make it 25 with 30,000 now 30,000
a year
who are working 50 60 hours a week
get time and a half
and and we need paid sick leave
and guaranteed vacation time for every
worker
in this country this campaign
starting today is going to send a
message
the billionaire class and that is
you can't have it all you can't get
huge tax breaks while children in this
country
go hungry you can't continue
sending out job abroad wild million
are looking for work you can't hide your
property in the Cayman Islands
and other tax havens while they are on
math look unmet needs
on every corner up this nation total
billion a class of
I save that your degree has got to end.
you cannot take advantage all of the
benefits
America up if you refuse to accept your
responsibilities
and ideas why
we need a tax system which is fair
and Progresso which counsel wealthiest
individuals
and the largest corporations that they
are going to begin
to start paying their fair share our our
taxes
when we talk about power
we talk about Wall Street in my view
it is time to break up the largest
financial institutions
in this country Wall Street cannot
continue
to be an island unto itself gambling
trillion in risky financial instruments
while expecting the public the bail in
I'll
if a bank is too big to fail that bank
is topiary
to accept
if we are serious about a progressive
agenda that speaks to the D
of working families their talks about
climate change
and the needs about kids and the elderly
we marked
be focused on campaign finance reform
and a needed break constitutional
amendment
to overturn their interest Citizens
United decision
I am said it before and I'll say it
again
I will not nominate any justice
the Supreme Court who else not made it
clear that he or she
will mu to overturn that this actress
position
which is on the binding american
democracy longer-term
we need to go further in a stylish
public funding
on election I look to our future it is
clear to me
that the United States of America month
leave the world in reversing climate
change
weekend do not
like transforming our energy system
away from fossil fuels for energy
efficiency
and thought sustainable energy use when
so solar geothermal and biomass
brothers and sisters the United States
of America today
remains the only major country on earth
but does not guarantee health care
to all people as the right
despite the modest gains of the
Affordable Care Act 35 million Americans
continue to have no health insurance
an even more are under insurer
yet despite that pathetic record
we end up spending almost twice as much
per capita on health care is any all
about
nation in March strong a pic
United States March drawing the rest of
the industrialized world
and guarantee health care to all as a
right in
and we both stored through a Medicare
for All
single-payer program
out at a time
when millions of Americans are
struggling to keep their heads above
water economically
and a time when senior poverty is
increasing
at a time when millions of kids in this
country
don't get enough food the my Republican
colleagues
as part of their recently passed budget
are trying to make
a terrible situation even worth if you
can believe it and this is the true
the republican budget rose $27 million
Americans
awkward health insurance makes drastic
cuts in Medicare
growth billion low-income Americans
including
pregnant women of good nutrition
programs
and makes it hard on stroke and makes it
horrible working-class families
to afford college or put their kids
in the head start program
and then to add insult to injury
the republican budget provides you tax
breaks
for the very richest people in this
country while they raise taxes
on working family
well let me tell my Republican
colleagues
that I respectfully disagree
with their approach %uh instead of
cutting Social Security
we are going to expand social security
card
%uh instead of cutting head start
and child care we are going to move to a
universal
pre-k system for all the children of
this country as Franklin Delano
Roosevelt reminded of
a nation's greatness is George not quite
what it provides
to the most well-off wonder how it
treats the people
most Indy and dodi is what kind of
country
we must become %uh
and when we talk about education
let me make it very clear in a highly
competitive global economy
we need the best educated workforce we
can
create it is insane it is
counterproductive
to the best interests of our country
that 100
of thousands up right young people can
not
up Lloyd to go to college and that
millions of others
leave school with a mountain of debt
that burden them
put back in
this is not what a great country it's
about
that most and not it's why I as
president well
fight to make to we're sure in in public
colleges and universities free
%uh
as well as substantially lower interest
rates one student loans
and
the young people all over our country
our book young chop
they've gotta get the education they
need %uh
as everybody knows we live in a
difficult
and dangerous world and there are people
out there
who would do us harm as president I will
defend this nation
but I will do it responsibly as a member
of congress
I voted against the war in Iraq and I
walked alright bro
%uh
I am vigorously oppose
to enlist perpetual walk in the Middle
East
yes we must be vigorous and calm banning
terrorism
and the feeding ices but we as a nation
should not
have to bear that burden alone we must
be part of an international coalition
led by the Muslim nations that could not
only to be like this
but begin the process up creating
conditions
well last week please out
as some love you know
I was born in a faraway land called
Brooklyn New York
my father came to this country
from poland without a penny in his
pocket
and having dropped out a school at a
young age
my mother graduated high school in New
York City
my father worked his entire life is a
pain
salesman never made much money
my parents and my brother and I live in
a small red control
apartment my mother's dream what's the
mood I love that
ball three and a half room apartment and
get a home
up her own she died young and her dream
was
noble bill as a kid I learned in many
many ways
everyday in my house what lack of money
means
to a family and that is the lesson
then I have noble begotten and never
will
forget in
I have three
I have seen as many of you have the
promise of America or
in our own life my parents nap
notebook nap when I'm bring that they
are fun
to become the United them let alone run
for president what put through many
about fellow American the dream progress
an opportunity
is being denied why the grind of an
economy
that funnel virtually all of the well
and although bn.com
to the top and to those who say
we cannot risk or withdrew ice age of
war
where we are standing today as love you
will remember
this beautiful place was once an
unsightly rail yard
that serve no public purpose it was an
eyesore
ever mayor I worked with the people of
Burlington
to help turn this waterfront into the
beautiful people oriented public space
it is still a
we talk bad fight
the courts the legislature and to the
people
and we won the lesson to be learned and
it is a profound political
lesson is that when people span
to get went people are prepared to fight
back
there is not think that cannot be
accomplished and
we
can live in our country where every
person out health care is a right
not a privilege we can live in a country
where every parent get a quality and
affordable trial cow
and where all of our qualified young
people to get a college education
regardless of their income we can live
in a country
where every senior up can live in
dignity and security and not be fourth
the truth between food and medicine
we can live in a country
where every veteran was quote him for
our life on the line
the bandits nation gets to how quality
health care
and benefits they are burned and deserve
we can live in a country
where every person no matter no matter
their race
their religion their disability or their
sexual orientation
realizes the full promise of equality
that is our birthright
as americans
brothers and sisters not
is the nation weekend bill
together and I asked you
and people throughout this country to
join of
in there campaign to build a future that
works for all of us
and not just a few people archtop

me
ladies and gentleman we
stay around for another concert with
mango jailed

dollars every year to lock up fellow
Americans are clearly we can do a lot
better but we are not going to do a lot
better unless we break through some old
ideas and that's what this panel's about
this is a great pile of what we're going
to do after our panelists speak we're
going to open it up to you all talked
for a while and it was your ideas
this is gonna be a town meeting an
informal discussion to address a very
very serious issue and I without further
ado let me introduce the old woman who
has been a champion not just on this
issue comes from Cleveland but on issues
impacting glowing common working people
you know in america today their issues
were allowed to talk about issues were
not allowed to talk about poverty is one
of the issues apparently there were not
allowed to talk about
despite the fact that we have forty
seven million people living in poverty
center dot
does talk about poverty does talk about
the needs of working people does talk
about a broken criminal justice system
and we are so delighted that she's a lot
about campaign senator needed
country in this country
the problems that are facing this nation
are generational issues
Ohio State University President of the
United States
the land of the free home of the brave
come back home and we have a problem
that is going to take
middle-class black and brown
important that we all take a look at
what is happening in the criminal
justice system and start to treat folks
who come back out of that system and
welcome them back into our communities
and help them to be able to live out
their greatest greatness we do that
together
people who have their lives and orally
transforming their lives using their
lives to make sure that younger people
do not go through the same experiences
that they have gone through and I have
and I would hope all of you have just
the enormous respect for the courage
determination that they have shown so it
gives be a great deal of honor and a
privilege to introduce jerome miller is
a form of conflict has been in
penitentiary and he's gonna talk a
little bit about his life he's welcome
Andrew Miller
three years here in Iowa for drugs and I
have three years in Colorado for drugs I
came out in 2008 so I'm home about five
years when we did things that kept me
home is the fact that I got tired of
what was my self and I figured out stock
take control of my life I've met anybody
else write the book about troubles
school this is like the latter part of
my life is tough for me to take my book
wrapped up in it right the rest of my
story and make my happened
one of the reasons that I was able to
get out of change I did myself decided
to do things I'm studying just to stay
and that's sitting around talking just
to talk with congress has seen the probe
boy 18 months after 35 years with a team
of mandatory sentence I see the board in
eighteen months and they told me I don't
have enough time so they said we might
see next year I wrote them and say thank
you give me the opportunity I understand
have 35 years and maybe i'll be
satisfied with his eighteen months
however I will see you again and I will
continue doing the things that happened
I seen here they ask me a question is
very important question is that the
senator from Ohio had he said why should
we let you go home and I say because of
still useful please do not put me inside
the warehouse on a show and let me say I
am useful I can use my experiences that
all good to help those who unfortunately
may be traveling the way that I have
traveled five years later I am now in my
master degree in Drake I dropped out it
is great in 1988 and Gary G the New York
State Penitentiary and now again I mean
my master's degree
that most of family members are
incarcerated in the apt to go through
work-release probably would be forced to
me and when you go to 42 morning they
give you piece of paper and they tell
you to go find a job that's all they do
well I haven't been used the
penitentiary three here again and in
those three years I have been to a lot
of things and I had to learn how to deal
with with no help so I've learned how to
do with myself without those reports
that the senators were mentioning a prob
be back and I did have been exports I
own my own agency no reason why all my
own agencies because nobody would give
me a job and my job to do something
that's behavior helping to ensure I have
been apparent partner for those who
don't know that I was a people who help
other people who have lost eight
children because of drugs of choice for
them to jump through hoops at the ages
and do what they need to do to get the
children I feel great all those things
in those things keep me free I believe
that if you give somebody the
opportunity to serve special just coming
out the attack that opportunity and a
lot of them will stay
we won't see all this going back with
Dad I'm gonna pass it on to senator
thank you very much the attack
very much very honored to introduce
rueben johnson rubin similar way to draw
has also experienced the inside of a
penitentiary please welcome rueben
johnson thank you are a lot of cases a
lot of cases that does not exist does
not exist unless you have some family
support unless you have some gentleman
who have been in prison I can speak
directly to you about their experiences
nine times out of 10 they have nothing
to speak about my experience when I left
the jury in Illinois I was released from
joliet state penitentiary the day before
I was released I did not know I was
going to be released had no idea so
someone finally came to my cell said
packaged up you going home
great exciting I'm wondering what the
next steps will be driving those next
steps so when I'm when I get released I
get taken to the front door of the state
prison to await my ride they give me a
time believed it had $75 and perhaps and
that was it was a little late they tell
me to sit on a bench and weight I didn't
know what to expect
yet I was expecting something in my mind
I was like should I be getting something
is there no paperwork
steps and I need to follow when I get
back out nothing my brother comes to
pick me up his unlicensed driver he's X
fell when I get in the car he has
marijuana and drink for me
congratulations glad you home let's
party unfortunately I am impoverish I
have to go back to my home my friends
these are my friends they say man I'm
glad you're home and it went to give me
things during legal to allow me to get
some money so that they say you get back
on your feet
these are my friends enforcing this all
I had available to me at that point
that's not what I wanted but I didn't
know where else to look I felt as if I
should want something else but I didn't
know where else to look site so here I
kinda expected I would be released I
went to see the parole board similar and
in the parole board meeting they have a
list of questions that they typically
action and these are list of questions
that they axe everybody different cases
different demographics different
understandings different backgrounds
questions for everybody
eventually because I may be in 2004 the
questions so I asked the crisis in the
manner in which to parole officers and
their grandma perot that's not to say I
hadn't changed I had learned anything
why did learn something I learned what
they wanted to hear when they ask these
questions any benefit me so I was able
to be released from prison while I was
in prison have programs that you must be
a part of your response but when I'm in
prison to those programs is to show I
have to show up and sign my name that I
was here from that point I could fall
asleep the instructor does not work in
the prison he has no responsibility
whatsoever to ensure that I follow this
program or even learn from the program
he's being paid to show up and
facilitated class and he does that to my
understanding probably doesn't work out
I'll probably
he does it well so i didnt gathered that
much from that idea gained something
that I found out about it gathered that
much from that so apparent in the
granite to perot to be released
account like the same thing happened
over again I'm expecting something I
feel like something soon happen so they
tell me I'm going to work release center
he mentioned in its support to more like
okay so I understand that there will be
a little bit more development maybe some
skills training if you will I don't know
but no not not not at all you get there
you have to establish a banking account
because they want to keep track and
manage your money for you
they're nice that way they will also
give you the piece of paper that he
mentioned where you must go out and you
find a job now kinda like what's wrong
said what's wrong came out me and him
and I was able to assist him with finest
employment that he became successful way
I was able to develop him to the point
where he was able to run off on his own
to find that development that's almost
was my expect expectation in this work
release center but that's not what they
do again they'll just give you this
piece of paper and they require you to
go out and get that job I was not from
the Morni why do I knew nothing about
the morning I was a really didn't have
them when I want free and I didn't know
where employers was I didn't even have
work experience on my resume is gonna be
takin it had dropped out of school so I
don't have a full level of education
either if not for a friend of mine who
happened to be incarcerated telling me
you know they hired me over here and
they're still hiring they'd like us you
need to come out here so I went out
there the interview process is very
simple
probably could they just want to feel
cease to try to feel their full-time
employee quota and I met that so they
hired me but if not for that gentleman
introducing me to that I would not have
had that opportunity but it turns out is
the same employment opportunity talked
about and we made it a point to go out
and seek individuals who were just
recently let out of prison who didn't
have many skills are many educational
opportunities and we brought them in
right I won't take up too much more
determined to make sure you maybe you
actually later on but throughout my time
was released from prison in 1999 and to
this day I have a receipt of aidid I'm
proud of that I haven't even thought
about that thank you thank you I
appreciate it
that's my job that's what I should be
doing but throughout that time I have
met and I cannot even count among my
hand how many I'm no one special but I
have meant I can't count among my hand
without roughly see about 15 different
male individuals who if I hadn't had the
experiences that I had to make me a
little upset angry and I want to make
sure that this gentleman doesn't go to
that either they're about roughly 10 to
15 individuals who have have felony
records in our model was supposed to
socialize with wife had given them an
opportunity in their life today they
have never been back to prison want
their gainfully employed summer pursuing
her master's degrees in college I mean
they're making so many improvements
they're getting married they're not even
running the streets in that type of
matter anymore
some of cannot drink some of stop
drinking I don't take credit for it what
I do know is I gave them the motivation
to be able to pursue their dreams in a
manner however legally this was
something that I was not supposed to be
able to do legally this was something
that I was not supposed to do I want you
guys to think about that if this young
lady accidentally makes a mistake in her
life and they consider it fell in
felonious a felon she is removed as a
resource from just about everybody else
in this room if we were and I don't
think that's fair because I know she has
something and I'll be able to benefit
from something that'll be able to impact
my life what does that mean we are
giving back to our community we're
giving back to our families were giving
back to our country in this particular
manner that's all I have a will take up
too much time thank you guys for allow
me to come here and speak in this manner
but I do hope that this allows us to
open on my open our eyes to the
demographic that we are singling out
we're targeting I understand that
they're criminals out there need to be
in prison but we have to make sure we're
doing our weights and balances we get
the right people in the right places
a long speech what I want to do is open
let me throw out some questions that
maybe we may want to think about why is
it that in America we have so many
people in jail
number one why is it disproportionately
black and brown what are some of the
laws out there
minimum sentencing so-called war on
drugs what impact does all of that house
on the high rates of incarceration in
America are we doing anything close to
what we should be doing in terms of
dealing with high rates of recidivism in
other words you heard both of these guys
talking about you know when you come out
of jail is there a path is there other
programs available to help you get your
feet back on the ground or you simply
given a piece of paper and save 75 bucks
and good luck to you and if that's the
case why is not surprising that so many
people end up back in jail so those are
just some of the issues that come to the
top of my my other issues out there that
we didn't talk about art and I'm the
former chairman its interest former
chairman of the Senate Veterans
Committee and in somehow I think there's
some kind of correlations a relationship
with people come home for what about the
wives girlfriends in the children how
they impact on this whole process that
were the talk about what percentage of
kids whose parents are in jail with
themselves end up in jail
the answer is obviously it's a very very
high percentage but if Dad is arrested
in goes the job of the family so some of
my questions are you have other
questions let's open up so just
introduce yourself
be as loud as you can only hope Michael
Cedar Rapids hold up my clothes over
there we we welcome you and your guests
here today one of the questions that
came up to us while we were just sitting
here is what about having the voting
rights restored to think about
and I have the numbers varied here in my
speech but I'll give it over to draw
well governor we all make mistakes and
makes worst mistakes and others and if a
person has proved to be able to think
now more productive way I think certain
rights should be restored so they can be
a full citizen of this country we have a
lot to offer I mean right now as
second-class citizens
that's something that will make me hope
you know
able to do the things I do when I have
came as far as I came in five years
because I have a purpose other purpose
than anybody X card beautiful person for
the job of a life happens when you
retire you know lost like leader purpose
right so helping allow us to help this
is democracy that we have will help us
feel like part in that outside inside
the lawn outside outlaws enough
13% 13%
anyone thinks by the way just like to
point out that almost made the main
point you did you time to time you saw
it
why should that crime take away your
right to participate in american
democracy now there are states like my
by the way with the limbs to vote and we
have got to make that universal people
have paid their price but that does not
mean they should not be able to
participate in the democratic system
very very good question are at four
percent of people in jails and prisons
have some sort of mental health
challenge and you mentioned earlier that
is a word that we don't like to talk
about mental health is something that is
a huge contributing factor to people
ending up in jails and prisons and
especially in the state of Iowa we just
closed two of our mental health
facilities I know the governor would
like to close a third and when people
have nowhere to go for mental health
treatment often times they end up in
jail or prison so
to the point right away
absolutely great our time and ask these
guys need a job as well
mental health issues people behind bars
what's the correlation what's the
speakers speaking about the
african-american community and other
minority communities go to something
that is has always been somewhat
downplayed region to be very secretive
far as that's concerned access ability
to get to a mental health facility is
another thing that might interfere with
a person getting that so most minorities
do get their medical treatment while
incarcerated in the treatment they learn
how to deal with it
come home we maybe six months worth of
medication if they have medication and
so we don't have no rights to go back in
they call themselves and some medicated
so we have some services that connects
from the penitentiary to society
rubin Hansen and I'm going to ask you
guys to think about what percentage of
people I don't know of anyone does but
what percentage of people behind bars in
fact or medicated is there a lot of
medicine
I don't know too much about the mental
health in a clinical diagnosis would
have to be honest with you I'm skeptical
of it I know it's used as a tool is it's
it's especially for younger people
that's when they started out you know
about his nose you with a problem right
here I guess that's the reason why I'm
sending you to prison later on down the
line you can't learn your enable to
change there's you have issues you have
mental health let's go ahead and get him
incarcerated because before you get
incarcerated as they so you dream that
there's rehabilitation is true but there
seem to be able to address once you're
incarcerated not troops are they going
to what you're talking about
that's where the medication comes in it
I'm the doctor in the prison it's a
prison it's really big I got a lot of
people who were considered clinically or
mental health issues where I would
rather just medicate some that I don't
want to deal with no service on that I
do so the medication rate is high so you
end up coming out of prison and I need
to sustain bed so that I don't want some
of the people in prison or on that
occasion yes and when they got out of
prison what happens when they get out of
prison that medication becomes more to
the financial room now there's a huge
benefit and it's so particularly
probably can't afford it right so you go
to the alternative I don't know you know
if you pay attention to the news of you
do studies right they go from prescribe
medication that makes you feel some type
of way to go find that drugs on the
street so whether it's something to make
you feel relaxed Michael find marijuana
heroin but something made you feel hyper
you might go find cocaine or whatever
the case may be right so it's just again
the coping mechanism whether it's mental
help with this guy that was in prison
with the guy that doesn't have support
whatever you going to try to find what
you can do to cope because there's
nothing out here to help you
plotted it is the gap right because
again they just let you out it's not I
let you out in the visa services going
around right so we can make sure that
you still at which helps the person who
just came out of it provides jobs for
individuals
things that I let me jump in and ask a
question
rubin's those tell me if I got it right
let you how was 75 bucks right ok
75 bucks many people who get out have
been receiving medication in jail in a
limited amount money you don't have a
job you may not have job training and
yep I'm about the suite of it is I
represented as a significant amount of
money as individual to the prison
complex and they are determined to get
their money so even when you're out you
owe them their money they typically say
restitution they might see a state like
your paper you paid your paper you
eventually you pay for the medication
that you were giving them their you pay
for all the services you pay for the
treatment but it is not itemized on that
building just lumped into one so-called
restitution if you will and has not
taken off you will you like just getting
out of jail without a job but in the UK
for supervision so yeah right
assumption that you have the $300
doesn't matter who you guys know this is
my only person was rumored into this if
you go to Polk County stake in its
contractual so they give you piece of
paper that you sign your name or
nickname I can we take what happens you
will be charged but you probably won't
go to write you probably be paid because
that's what they need to do but you
might just get along
art so what we're hearing is your lease
no job no source of income
75 bucks maybe in your pocket you may be
on medications which have created a
certain feeling in you that you're going
to have to deal with the outside and on
top of that money nobody like you had a
case manager say every X every person is
about to leave out a statement
attributable to each entry had a case
manager that person would be somebody
there to organize these services around
that one person is no money in the mail
and we have to come to grips with that
in the question about mental health and
I'm so glad that the young lady brought
that up most of the women and we have to
talk about women in the sisters who are
in prison right now most women are
non-violent offenders as well so we're
locking them up many of them not all
because we need to care about single
women as well as single men and women
don't have children but then just think
about the women who do have children I
will compounding that because lots of
homes especially in poor communities and
especially in african-american
communities are single mother here
household over 70% of the mama is locked
up where are the resources for the
children but to her mental health point
lots of women are on that mental health
track and they don't have the support
that they need when they come out so we
should not be surprised and I'm with you
tsunami that the charging of folks but
we should not be surprised as a nation
we know that the system itself is is is
created to help them go back to prison
really is so your point senator about I
hope you'll talk about that
taken away to profit doing away with
core profit
let me just pick up on the point that
senator tournament animal open it up I
think this one is a no brainer we have
introduced legislation corporations
should not be profiteering through the
incarceration of fellow Americans and
the discussion from cedar rapids and in
my neighborhood its 50 percent black
it's not for and I agree with everything
people are saying but I still don't
think we're talking about the white
elephant in the room which is over half
of our prison population is there for
nonviolent drug offenses you can't solve
a problem if you continue to throw
people in prison for doing nothing hurts
anybody but themselves and in most cases
doesn't hurt themselves what we have is
gutless politicians who won't stand up
and say we're on Drugs is a complete and
total failure in needs to stop now
questions right
many of you may not get the federal
level at the federal level we have
controlled substance act this is federal
war with rocks right now on schedule 1
you have heroin and alongside her when
you got marijuana that makes sense that
he is introduced legislation that takes
marijuana completely out of the
Controlled Substances Act is a federal
crime
I really like going to the kind you
places like how you do it away you know
you can't get a job we go back to the
same old thing I was talking about the
war on drugs when a police record means
of things he'll want to say a word
proud of being black
there and then all of a sudden I don't
know we're in my mind becomes crack
cocaine and Yes it was my choice you
know but I wasn't warned about you know
when that time it was ok you know so we
tried and that was it and I know people
today who was still underneath that same
illusion from the eighties still chasing
that same fortunately our children they
don't do it because they see how to fix
does but it's still a whole generation
of experience that could have been given
granted to the babies that were behind
us and I'm very angry about the reasons
why I did pick being a drug counselor so
that I can help that type of situation
because honestly we allow some of course
to race IBM black brown white whatever
to color with a record of service to
everybody has something to think about
me
11 years in the penitentiary I changed
my life the fact I change my life I
change over people's I have declined I
do with white black yellow pages of 1765
and if it wasn't for me change my life
being dole's opportunities I was able to
grasp what I couldn't help this so we
hope it helps everybody you helping us
everybody all the questions I spent some
time working with foster care youth aged
16 to 21 it was a mentoring program for
kids
it was a voluntary program so they
didn't they had to have a caseworker but
they didn't have to work with our
program but it was an incentives based
program so if they met goals they could
receive incentives and it was a
government program so we worked at the
Department of Human Services and it was
a really great program and it was pretty
well funded and I felt like we had a lot
of success with the kids that we're
willing to come work with us but the day
they turn 21 they're no longer eligible
for any of those services and percentage
of former foster care youth who end up
homeless at some point in their lives
over half in many states the percentage
of former foster care youth that end up
in prison like where the number of
inmates who are former foster care youth
is over half in most states and I'm just
curious what we can do as a society to
help change our perspective that when
someone is 12 13 14 18 19 20 that they
deserve our support they deserve access
to mental health care services they
deserve
adults who are there as their mentors or
people who have his wide access to
services professional services but
always then when they're 21 they're
supposed to have all their lives
together
they don't have a support network if
they haven't built it through the
professionals that have been working
with them if they don't have it in them
to make it I I don't know what the
answer is but they're still clearly this
funneling of of kids who grew up without
the support that they need it oftentimes
children of people who have been
incarcerated and then end up in the
system sometimes successful system
sometimes unsuccessful system but
regardless whether 21 then it's just cut
off I think through a slot and give it
to the panel as well we have by the way
exactly the same problem for most likely
the same as the society what we have got
to establish be clear about is what our
priorities are is 21 some kind of
magical number so I'm still struggling
when I am 21 trying to do the right
thing right trying to get my feet on the
ground doesn't make any sense in the
world because of the magical number of
points 21 that you pull the rug out from
under those kids and take away the
support system that has kept them alive
and a whole bunch of their lives
frankly I'm gonna tell us which is not
necessarily relevant to your question
but it talks about what we can do what
we want to do it
southern part of my state there was a
principal of a high school this woman
was virtually but not about determining
the kids will not drop out of high
school
hard determination was the kids were not
going to slip through the cracks and
throughout our society that's what
happens billions of times people slip
through the cracks who gives a damn
about that case she gave a damn about
every kid in school she hired mentors
you know what the Mendes da bus kids can
call up that mentor at three o'clock in
the morning if there's a fight between
your parents or bad things are happening
you call up the Metro at three o'clock
in the morning and she or he will be
there for you you are not
going to drop out of school because we
love you and because we're concerned
about your future and she had an
extraordinarily positive result in terms
of keeping people from dropping out of
school
getting jobs but they did it helping
them financially helping them get the
college if that was their goal that's
the bottom line the bottom line is we
now what has to be done they are always
so I come from a family where my dad
came to this country
age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket
he dropped out of school never had much
education my brother graduated high
school that was it I want the college
frankly I was a little bit + hang around
with lawyers kids business people skills
the doctors kids was very insecure about
that this program out there soon return
i'd like you know it the trio program
you know what they do they say to kids
walk 4112 what ten you're not you want
to go to college willing to work with
you within a two year college campus in
a scary thought is anybody else even if
those are the kids up money and your
family does not have an extraordinary
really successful record what's the
bottom line the bottom line is we now in
many cases what has to be done to crush
the news putting the resources into
doing what has to be done
not wanting to punish people wanted to
say hey you're 21 you're out on your own
now good luck you'll hear 75 bucks
you're out of jail you can do it if we
want to make sure that what the kids the
well we know how to do it if we want to
make sure that people who released from
jail do not go back to jail
we know how to do that as well comments
schools and in some way we can connect
the school school should know the
condition of every child in skul they
are the foundation because every child
in this country has to go to school so
there to answer a community safety net
is an answer as well you know age ain't
nothing but a number as as they say it
really is and my son who is a police
officer he just turned 26 he is
independent but he's not because I mama
you know and he's fortunate enough to
have a mother and a father does not go
beyond him all the time even though we
raised him right he had a period of time
especially during the Great Recession
after he graduated with young folks
couldn't
college degrees but he was fortunate
enough to have two parents who can catch
a lot of children don't have that
whether foster children are not absolute
right we have a throwaway mentality in
the society if children don't fit a mold
we throw them away so I believe that the
school system though is the key because
they're the foundation to catch all the
children the ballot box can I just say
that because when we elect people in the
elected ministry who care about the
folks they were elected to serve then we
can have policies back to senator
Sanders point that will do the things
that we need to have done you cannot be
fun programs like that and then expect
these children to be okay you can't be
fined or close down mental health
institutions and think that people are
going to be okay you can't collect
amounts of money off the backs of people
who have fallen on hard times in this
country and think that things are going
to be ok you know I'm a college
professor as well as I know that trio
program very will on the first day of
class I usually ask us to do what they
want to be when they grow up and it
doesn't matter if the 1830 or 65 at
their my class if you are living you
should have a dream in a vision for your
life and I have yet to have one of my
students a to follow US Attorney when I
grow up I want to be poor or when I want
to go to prison that's the life for me
I'm looking forward to this journey
everybody has a dream with somehow along
the way it is snuffed out by Assad's he
debt does not clear if we could just
have some compassion and empathy but
then elect folks senators and to say
give a damn I want to say let people
give a shit Douglas once and not quoting
him exactly but he said something along
these lines that is a better investment
to invest in children in broken mean and
that is what we have to do we can start
right there but the school system
the school system is the best
institutional answer that we had just 1
I'm a proud progressive but any
conservative out there should be
listening to senator Turner promising as
well because the evidence is
overwhelming that when you invest in the
children when you invest in the services
when make sure the kids get a good
education or a good job you save
substantial sums of money
to the University of Iowa is a hell of
alot cheaper that given them up and tell
young lady talk I have my son my son is
running track schools drive and I think
that's very important as a parent
partner again apparently there's a
person who is a role model for
individuals already have been going to
DHS issues now they have and as a parent
point-blank noticed a regardless of what
society says it does most likely most
likely the child
i dont kids one year after two years
after two years after I know young man
has 21 placements and his twenty
one-year-old they cut him off he found
his mom and put me with that jail and
with my son you know the children want
to be with his parents so let's look at
the same with lost a parent a rights
come home and they're in contact with
the force to cure her sin city not a
doctors say they're still in foster care
in this person shows for an adequate
amount of time that they able to
function in our society in the
mannerisms which is appropriate
questions I'm right here I'm actually go
but I go to school
Rapids so I grew up why mexican-american
and so I grew up we don't have cable or
anything
this has a point I promise
and so so I want a lot of like a PBS and
whatnot and so I remember growing up
most of the characters I mean I know
their animals but like most of the
characters I assumed a white and so like
growing up it was kind of hard to
believe myself and so I was wondering if
there's any way that we can make like
public broadcasting television and legal
you require adversity and not just one
character for me traes protagonist of
various races and stuff like that so
that'd be nice I'm gonna give his
campaign but I've been talking about is
my fears that economically we are moving
toward an oligarchic former society
where a small number of very very
wealthy people are receiving today
almost all of the new income in the new
wealth politically I worry that as a
result of citizens united billion as of
buying elections but it also worried
about the media billion raises an issue
1 issue this is what I worry about I
think you can watch television 24 7 and
not get a feeling that what you see is
the reality of american life in many
respects you're talking about race
relations in a sense united people of
your background on television
okay what i'm talking about also and
then return them at this point a moment
ago we just came out of the worst
economic downtown downturn in the modern
history of this country since the Great
Depression millions of people walk their
draws millions of people lost their
homes
millions of people lost their life
savings the day in America you have a
middle class which is disappearing you
have in some cases
people's life expectancy going down
massive despair reflected on television
is the reality of America reflected in
the struggles that people are making
half of the people 55 years of age or
older
up to 65 50 savings for retirement that
at seven years of age you got nothing in
the bank how do you think you feel
you're scared to talk about it NBC ABC
soap operas so much not so much so your
point is right and i agree with you but
it's easy
deeper than that we are a country where
millions of people are in despair black
white
they want to see your reflection of
their realities in media and in many
respects they are not in NA say who the
hell is talking about my life who knows
about my life why should I vote nobody
cares about nobody even knows what's
going on in my life so media becomes a
very important part of the reality of
American I think we need some big
changes that anyone want to do that
part of how things are
how we're losing control as a country is
that we are at each others throats I
think that there's a lot of different
brands that we tend to fall under the
Sooners talking about pretty much in
what is pretty much effect is more than
anything else in my belief is classes
are being one another for one reason or
another so that we cannot come together
and figure out what needs to be done
while those who are supposedly sitting
above economic coup culpability looking
and plotting how can we keep them
confuse so we can keep making
however I also know that those issues my
royalty passed the Senate see that might
just be a first talked about that
worry about that wow they were they
maybe I still plotting and planning to
confuse from just very profound point
just pick up on it
want you to hear this in america today
the top one tenth of one percent not 1%
1.1% owns almost as much wealth as the
bottom 90% wealthiest 20 people in this
country 12 to 20 people on more wealth
than the bottom 50% of the american
people hundred and fifty million people
58 percent of all new income generated
today
58% is going to the top 1% you seen on
tv likely not too much and what's wrong
I rather have us fighting against each
other and black and brown and white gay
and straight you're born in Mexico
you're born in America
well with mexico but let's talk about
that let's not talk about how we come
together to create an economy that works
well rather than the top one percent
everybody who are real American heroes
are about I cannot begin to imagine the
kind of strength that was required to
transform their lives and to make the
point that what they want to do with
their lives and what makes them stronger
human beings is actually help other
people I want to thank them very much
what they are doing what their
participation in this panel that I want
to thank all of you for coming out for
helping us address one of the major
crises facing this

the

today
to be that noise and beauty here that
was directly Sullivan give you a great
big
what Minnesota well behind them

the

whole thing flying 200 people

a lot of old
everybody would like very much the
live near your home just tell you about
the client we
that we've had which is pretty crazy on
Tuesday
always thought all informally to go on a
campaign to my hometown
a Burlington Vermont we are over 5,000
people government-held
never want to go ahead sure standing
room only in a bed after bed
after that last couple days when you
know I was just looking for the very
worst lots
handbook and what we're doing here today
and video the
so I think it is a to say it
that we are all to ensure all start-up
in this if you have a name a campaign
which is calling for
a political revolution they're just like
the
now little water 30 and this is what I
mean from the bottom of my heart
and also with everything that I believe
them intellectually
I heard the jams burning burning burning
and I appreciate that
but this is not about burning it really
is about you
and when I just bought a lot of
political revolution what everybody has
got on the slant
is not the only other classes and their
representatives in Washington on
so-called
that the best president in the world
cannot the
level all we need a mass movement of
millions of people with
the
the movement at all anymore stands all
it says loudly and clearly you that this
great nation on the house and our
government
belonged to Albany bowl and not just a
head cold
affiliate the
this country today the
faces more serious problems than at any
time since the Great Depression
and if you throw in if you add to that
the planetary prices %uh climate change
it
the problems today maybe even mall
Syrians and here is my promise to you
for this game today
not only will I quite to protect the
working families in this country
I'm but we all going to build
AP permanent move it in this country in
which we are going to the standoff
and final at and we're going to do that
not necessarily with millions of
30-second TV ads
we got the goal directly to the people
in meetings like that
the
and with your help we're going to be
knocking on doors
all over Minnesota all over america
level
and we're going to be doing our very
best didn't know working
families in this country that they
cannot continue 2000 he more working
night and day
I guess they are all less the
I no longer than I expected
the poet lowly an excellent all
at all over the body is mostly okay a
bottle or a lawyer all does the world
class
the bullet people rodeo
what you think in a way yeah 720
the
hey not solid challenge
massive education massive of catalyzing
headway we say get understanding yes but
we're never going to view on this issue
or that is true nobody is gonna be a
hundred percent
whatever you but we were you working
families together to say
we want our kids to be able to get a
good education
these jobs the shit out of him nobody
will stop on the
let me just very briefly very briefly
give you an overview of some of the
issues
there we are gonna be campaigning on to
my mind I'm
the most significant issue we face
is the world's best level often
commonweal
getting quality in america the
in america today %um we have more
in calm and wealth inequality than any
other major industrialized country on
earth
and it is worse today that any time
since nineteen the 20 know I know
years to overwhelm and income inequality
is the great moral you're still up on
him
it is a great economic gives you all the
time
it is a great political if you all out
of time
and we are gonna do. got into the
and my only aim be very clear about this
let me tell this
to the billionaire lol class that today
has it all
there is something profoundly wall
when the hard-won yeah all along
per se not 100 percent want to help one
percent
also also supports well as a lot of
ninety percent
they are resolving roles loudly wall
when not even be not lying were said
although income generated two-day
goal at the heart one of his own there
is something profoundly wall
when in recent years we have seen a
proliferation
up millionaires and billionaires while
the average American is working
water well as below last year's and we
have the highest rate of childhood
bloody
largo de Majo country on earth
there is something profoundly ruled
wind warning family in this country
almost as much as well as a lot on all
million Americans this
world-class level updating them all and
wealth inequality
is bad economics it is unsustainable
and this is what my upbringing economy
which america is not so but also
totally hot I'll this is not the James
the
Edward what you'll look at all it is
gonna change
because we are going to create an
account a million that works for all
bball and not just a handful of people
on the Tom
the
but it is not just incall and wealth
inequality is more than that
today in America local what we are
seeing is that all will last
quality you years last 40 years
great middle-class of this country
once the head be up to you by a world
has been disappearing the today
despite expanded my knowledge an
explosion
%uh technology and huge increase in
worker productivity
median family income is almost five
thousand dollars less
that it was in ninety 99
in my state overload and I'm short
minutes old
we have many more working not just one
job to job
three jobs trying to cobble together in
a column
and some pellicano that is not what this
economy
it's almost like they allow the
gruza the automobile i'm in in america
is not quite like four or so it's not
the
officials that is like don't you see we
got to go
the paywall if you include those people
who have given up looking for work
and all those people working part-time
real unemployment in america today
is close to 11 presided you got
unemployment is seventy percent
african-american you love like that is
all good thoughts
today jangling
we have applauded by billion people
who are living in poverty and many of
them all working
forty or fifty hours alway
today
today we all live it
in a day should which has more well
then any shouldn't in the history
%uh the world but the problem here
that all will all that well
is going to go ahead well up people home
dots room is that in the last 30 years a
there has been a eulogy redistribution
well a it as a dog with a little
class done a very rich
and what we are saying today is it not
only is the No
we want not well the cod black the
working families
of the
now let me know much alone may not fully
healed
that is a huge consequences for our
country
and let me be as blunt as I can tell you
one
as I can be in the Holy Name you like
many of you already know
and that is as a result of the
disastrous Supreme Court decision
on citizens united the American
political says the has been slowly
corrupted
and the well you should pull American
democracy
got the
what the supreme court house actually
set
to the wealthiest people in this country
the billionaire class
what is it is are you guys already own
mucho you gonna be
now we're going to give you the
opportunity to all
the United States government and state
governments all
this country I'm and that is precisely
what these people on now trying to do
american democracy is not allow home
billionaires being able to live
candidates
and elections it is not about the Koch
brothers
Sheldon Adelson and other incredibly
wealthy individuals
spending billions and billions of
dollars to elect candidates
who will make the rich richer and
everybody else
moral there was recently a media report
which is just that the whole world is
themselves
one of them second wealthiest American
12 family name will spend more money
in this election cycle then I will the
Democratic Party
all the republican party brothers and
sisters
that is not a democracy not cool
paula coughlin the
and when we talk about the major issues
facing our country and in fact
facing the world I'm when we talk about
our responsibility uses human beings
and as it turns a lot got want kids and
seven grandchildren
there is nothing more important then
leaving this country
end this planet in a way that is
inhabitable
for our kids and all branches of the
go home told me is all
the scientific community is virtually
unanimous
climate change Israel climate change is
caused by human activity
climate change is already causing
devastating problems
in our country and around the world
and if we do not get our act together
in years the car the situation will be
substantially world
what the scientists are telling us if we
allow businesses to go on as usual
by the end of this century the planet
/url could be buying to defend it really
is
paradigm wall of more riled
more floods more extreme weather
disturbances
more rising sea levels mauled minnesota
became shouldn't
more diamond more disease more human
suffering
we meeting must not allow got to happen
the
hacksaw mold all the big oil companies
in the Koch brothers a make a lot of
money and possible
you all day one on not to address this
issue 1
but we all understand that is caretakers
all our environment as many people who
enjoy a little Union
all our country and the planet we are
not going to allow them
do the following this blood but their
short term profits
the
know what are the challenges that we
face that it is a huge
time you know I'm
is that the american people want very
disillusioned
with the political muscles they are very
demoralized
in the last midterm elections
sixty-three percent
well people didn't bowl he
resigned young people the lovable
and all over this country people are
hurting
they're worried about their kids they're
worried about their parents
so worried about what happens to the win
the gold and we look to washington and
leasing
be those people they're not dealing with
the realities
my like and they listen to the media on
the television logo lol political gossip
are all kinds the ground and not talking
about the realities facing
ordinary Americans media looking at
politics is a war a baseball game was so
lopsided home
rather than addressing the issues as to
how we transform America what we need to
do in my view
you know the with your home and we have
a website which is
going to get better in bed at school
Bernie Sanders like um we want your
ideas we want your feedback is we'll go
together but
a sexually what we need to do use
creative in the region
very clear Jenn that makes sense to
working families
all over this country as to what I'm the
government should be doing
to transform our country. and improve
lives rolling
what I wanted to know in a few minutes
you would you really luv pretty quickly
young
I want to watch along well I think could
be innocent who will all be progressive
agenda on
and the person who now wield is when you
want to be when you want to be with you
do polls
what people always say when you ask them
what is the most important thing on
their minds
it so you cool little whirlwind gold
jobs
jobs and the reason they say that is the
No
that unemployment is much too long they
worry about the kids being able to get a
decent job
they worry that the usability they're
gonna be delayed a long time
and not be able to get a job that pays
them in half the wages they're currently
burning
so in my view we need the media room
federal jobs program degrees millions
apiece and then jobs the
now
and and a hole-in-one our infrastructure
is crumbling
1l rules out which is all water systems
always what our plans are at once I will
I'll let you use and what they mean
enormous amount to were a little
we ought not to invest happily and
in Wheeling this infrastructural and
when we do let
we make this country moral should what
would dilute
and save money and we can create with
the $1 trillion dollar investment which
I have a proposal up to 30 million
these many Jones the
to
little here is not only a marginal
creating jobs which we have to do it is
a question of saving and preserving jobs
you are looking at a United States I
don't know
who was voted against trade agreements
like nafta the
I voted against nafta you have to
remember the normal trade relations with
China I'm
and I'm gonna help lead his opposition
against the trans-pacific partnership
the
it smoothens that since 2001
in vermont in minnesota ran all over
this country we have lost
almost six the thousand back two reasons
and millions on these and many jobs we
all
who rawlins trade agreements that every
corporation in America and the drug
companies
and will bring wide open and when their
goal
is the greatest situation with a good
shot done in america
and we'll do low-wage countries an hour
job is done lol
that we want trade agreements the
wholesale for american workers
and workers on the board that we want
them to start creating jobs
in america auto not just good other
countries around the world the
and when we leave more lol the economy
when we talk about the economy
let's all hope in Clio that millions of
American workers all working good wages
on
what's not much much bloom lolol
the
welcome our earnings middle mobile
federal minimum wage
%uh seven dollars and twenty five
insights into how well
is a starvation wage we've got a razor
what a living wage the
as some of you may know the city of los
Angeles is a
recently raise the minimum wage there
are 15 bucks an hour over her in a few
years but not exactly but like a
for the we must obligate pay equity
for women workers the
it is in government support there is a
lot acceptable the women doing the same
work as men
make 78 cents on the dollar that's got
to change.
Ste
and we'll talk with whom respect and the
working people of this country in Olin
every worker in america auto
has been a bit sick leave bank guarantee
but he should buy
the
now when we deal with an incall in
wealth inequality what we have to
understand that
is not just another well-used people in
this country and the largest
corporations are doing phenomenally well
what we also have do understand is that
we have
8 axis global with his written by these
very same
we will and it's grossly on them so let
me be very clear
11 000 all the billionaires who watching
that the the
diploma like did the president know it
was not named

let me too much on time one other July
only ranking member world
although the Budget Committee know which
means Leader of the Opposition I want to
tell you something
medial kinda forgot to remove this so I
will mention unsealed
editable I'm when our middle class is
disappearing
I'm at a time when families in
Minneapolis
and in vermont are having a hard line
feeding
the kids at a time when an elderly
people
horseshoes between heating their homes
in the wind you're applying medicine are
getting the food that they need them
had a decline when working class
families cannot afford to send their
kids to college

ask Congress last month old
it roles $27 billion bball
up health insurance bowling ball
it and steel portable camera it makes
the $400 million dollar-plus model
in medicaid which will happily impact
families
whose parents are in nursing homes and
take away health care for low-income
families along its not a girl not how we
provide health care to wall
the 27 million people will help in terms
the republic in the budget
cause the helm grants by ninety billion
already
10-year period make you get a hotel the
young people who like
college the republican budget what

Wow that we've got tonight benefits with
the same old
veterans we say all our
dead bottoms the
goldman's gertrudis

Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid

a portable pre-k education the
nice things some people out there may
say well you know what bernie is talking
about is kinda expensive and it's kinda
Ronald
but let me tell you really it is not and
when I hold very much
you do not get close to home in the
mindset
dissolve the saloon around the country
today in the mindset is well we have a
deficit

different lujan beloit this country do
any
yeah the
we have see trillions of dollars all
will last
thirty years transit route for working
families and the middle class
upward and that is the premises on who
would you will begin
there's discussion I'm can we afford as
a nation
the reply free tuition ecologist because
we can't
can we have a higher quality excellent
trial has this little
which is a little to working families
%uh because weekend

industrialized world and other national
health care program

mobile uploads weekend

you only need to have the highest grade
on trial the bloody
have any major country on earth no we'd
all
the do we need to have a he economic
situated should
when ninety-nine percent in the cup goes
to the top one percent
dole we'll look so what if my holes
is too old for schools really Bernie
Sanders
can't do it alone we have got do we
would get along well
do a school on grassroots movement the
and stuck to the wall we have cock
Lincoln
the non small
we have dogs who in our own minds and
our own hearts
imagine in Asian in a government which
works cool
all lost not a government dominated by a
handful of billionaires
and campaign contributors and well-baby
lobbyists we hand create any
bad America I'll because when we stand
together on
they're all a heckuva lot more of a lost
then
call let's go home carpool during the
me
well

fighting for women's rights what you're
doing to expand and improve our
democracy one of the reasons and let me
be very blunt the baptists one of the
reasons I'm running for President of the
United States is that I worry very much
that both economically and politically
our country is sliding into our daughter
this is not an issue but they're gonna
see discuss much on TV but it is the
reality of what's happening in America
we all know wealthiest country in the
history of the world but as we speak
here and media this morning millions and
millions of families are struggling to
feed their kids we have the highest rate
shamefully of poverty of any major
country on earth and forty percent of
african-american kids are living in
poverty all at the same time
58 percent of all new income is going to
the top one percent and the top one
tenth of one percent bonds almost as
much well as the bottom 90% and as a
nation we are gonna have to ask
ourselves whether it is morally
acceptable whether it is economically
sustainable that's all few have so much
while so many have so little in my view
has got to change and we need an economy
that works for working families
economics it is politics as a result of
the disastrous citizens united Supreme
Court decision millionaires and
billionaires are pouring unlimited sums
of money in true the political process
through super PACs and independent
expenditures in the last election last
november sixty-three percent of the
American people didn't vote eighty
percent of young people didn't vote and
in today
millionaires and billionaires are buying
the election is that what democracy in
this country is supposed to be about I
think not
now the truth is all of you know
republicans win when voter turnout is
low when millions of people turn their
backs on the political process when they
look to washington and they sound
working longer hours for low wages what
are you doing for me when this I don't
have any health insurance what are you
doing for me when I say I can't afford
to send my little baby into decent
quality child care what are you doing
some kind of water so my older kids to
college
what do you do it for me and when people
give up on the political process and dog
vote in large numbers when republican
governors suppress the boat when the
co-processor the billionaire's trying to
buy elections Republicans win and we
look so what do we do what we do is make
it clear that in this country we need a
political revolution
shin
the same old same old way to do it
their establishment economics is going
to do it you want I'll tell you how you
win an election for the white house on
you rally millions of working-class
people were given up on the political
process
young people
political process you bring people
together who are prepared to say loudly
and clearly I love document belongs to
all of us not just a handful of billion
and if we do not do that and if this is
a same old same old type of election and
if millions of working people young
people do not participate
republicans will win and we will lose so
let me tell you I am extremely gratified
in my campaign so far that we have
rallied hundreds of thousands of people
to come out our meetings and events that
we have seven hundred and fifty thousand
individuals who have made campaign
contributions not million dollar
contributions to super PACs but $30
apiece warning that any campaign at this
point in a campaign in American history
we win when people come together when we
reject the division of men vs women are
straight forces gay a black versus white
are people born in this country as
opposed to people born in another
country that is what they wanted to go
when we stand together and we say you
know what
in the wealthiest country in the history
of the world the wealthy years people
and the largest corporations are going
to stop paying their fair share of taxes
we win elections when we say to the
working people in this country we know
you can't make it on eight or nine bucks
and hour and that is why we're going to
raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour
we're going to win the election when we
say two women there is no rational
economic reason that women make 79 cents
on the dollar compared to then we're
gonna pay equity we win an election in
which we say to working families yes
when you're going to work
you are going to have quality child care
and pre-k your little ones
where you win this election when we say
to the unemployed we're gonna rebuild
our crumbling infrastructure and create
millions of decent paying jobs and all
people that we wonder what world the
republicans are live again when they did
not use science and refused to go
forward in helping us combat climate
change
we win this election when we make it
clear that women have fought long and
too hot to lose control over their own
bodies we win this election when we
stand up boldly and say no you're not
gonna or defund Planned Parenthood you
gotta put more money so sisters and
brothers we are at historical moment in
American history the crises that we face
today in many ways are worse than any
time since the great depression of the
nineteen thirties and in my view the
what this election is about is not just
selecting a president Paul fall more
significantly it is about transforming
the United States of America
it is about understanding that there is
something very very wrong where the
united states of america is the only
major country on earth not guarantee
they'd Family and Medical Leave how does
that happen
country on earth does not guarantee paid
sick time or paid vacation time how does
that happen
the only major country on earth that
doesn't guarantee health care to every
man woman and child as a right
is to bringing people together by the
tens of millions not stop and it's tough
to do but if we do that when I just
gonna win this election we are going to
win it by a landslide because what
happens is how many people in your
communities believe as republicans do
that we should cut social security
medicare cut medicaid cut federal aid to
education and then give hundreds of
billions of dollars in tax breaks to the
top two two-tenths of one percent nobody
believes that but Republicans can win
elections because so many people have
given up on the political process and
what this campaign is about is
revitalizing american democracy by
bringing people together to stand up and
fight for the promise of what this great
country and be
a nation in which the middle class grows
not shrinks we can be a nation in which
we do not have the highest rate of
childhood poverty of any major country
and what economic and wealth disparity
we can do that but in order to do that
we're going to have to do something that
is pretty hard
pretty pretty pretty hard
this is what we have to do in the last
many decades everybody in this room
knows because you have been part of the
process we have made significant
progress in becoming a less
discriminatory society and we should be
proud that we should be proud then in
2008 the American people decided to vote
for a candidate based on his program and
his ideas and his character not the
color of his skin
all over this country as a result of
your efforts and those that came before
you women have made extraordinary
progress in breaking down discriminatory
or discriminatory barriers and by the
way we are not going back we're gonna go
close and if we were here ten years ago
and somebody jumped up and said you know
I think the gay marriage will be made
legal in every state in this country
somebody else would have asked them what
they were smoking which raises another
reason we have we have made progress
we've made progress in women's rights in
gay rights in civil rights we still have
a long way to go in all of those areas
but we should be proud of what we have
accomplished but here is where we have
not made progress we have not made
progress in the economic struggle we
have lost ground today men and women in
many cases are working longer hours will
lower wages of the new wealth and income
is going to the people on top so the
essential question in terms of economic
struggle is all we prepared to organize
and to take on the billionaire class
which today has so much economic and
political power that is the person and
if we are not successful in doing that
by prediction to you is that the rich
will continue to get richer while most
everybody else gets 40 my prediction to
you is that the republicans who do not
believe Citizens United went far enough
want to get rid of all campaign finance
regulations will simply be able
through the Koch brothers and others to
give checks of hundreds of millions of
dollars to the candidates of their
choice in other words having candidates
become employees of their corporate
interests that's the future if we do not
educate and if we do not organized but I
have confidence that we can do but I
have confidence that we have we come
forward with a progressive strong agenda
that he is prepared to stand up to
corporate america is prepared to stand
up to the Koch brothers and the
billionaire class that is prepared to
outline an agenda which will improve the
lives of tens of millions of our people
we can not only win the White House
regain the senate and the house gain
governors trails all over america not
only can we do that but much more
importantly we can't transfer law in
this country and make it the country we
all know that it can become thank you
all very much

by fall the higher prices in the world
for prescription drugs
now
losing their jobs

Brothers and sisters!
My name is John Nichols,
and I stand before you as a proud Wisconsin progressive.
I am here in the tradition of Robert M. Lafollette.
The Capital Times Newspaper, the Progressive Magazine, the Wisconsin Idea.
And the Wisconsin Uprising of 2011.
I am here to welcome you and I am here to welcome one of you.
Because Bernie Sanders is not separate from the people in this room.
I'm not here to make any endorsements or deliver any grand statements about what you should do in 2016.
That's not... That's not what the Wisconsin progressive movement was ever about.
The Wisconsin progressive movement was about citizens,
gathering in church halls, and schools, and union halls
and deciding the issues that mattered for them!
This has always been a people's movement.
And when leaders arrive the come from the people, they don't dictate to the people.
I'm serious when I say I'm not here to tell you what to do,
 you don't need someone to come up and tell you what to do,
 you don't need someone to come up and tell you what to think about the presidential race,
Senator Bernie Sanders will be here in a moment to make his case.
This campaign is all over this room, they've given you all sorts of information,
they want you to go to berniesanders.com,
they want you to text 82623, pull your phone out and do all that,
and type in Bernie and you' get updates all the time,
 they'll tell you all the bells and whistles.
I'm not here to do any of that.
I am here to tell you what you have already done.
Because what you have already done is more important
than any thing that any candidate will do.
What you have already done
is demand that the 2016 presidential race
have a progressive voice at the table.
And you... You demanded that it be someone who came from you, someone who you knew.
You demanded, that it be someone who has marched with you, someone who has rallied with you,
someone who knows Ed Garvey, and who has campaigned with Ed Garvey,
ladies and gentlemen,
the man who rebuilt the progressive movement in this state,
(?) the father of fighting Bob Fess: Ed Garvey, right here, up front.
Right in front of him, to rows up, the mayor of Madison Paul Soglin right here with us tonight.
Couple steps away from him,
State Senator Fred Risser the longest-serving legislator in the United States.
State Representatives Terese Berceau, and... And Melissa Sargent and a dozen others I can't even pick out here.
It's a remarkable thing that's going on and I want you to know
that a year ago, when Bernie Sanders said to me that he was thinking of running for president of the United States
I had my doubts.
But... But then... But then Bernie Sanders said you know wha... 'cause
he was pretty sure it was going to work because he said he wasn't going to do it like other people did it.
He was going to do it as a movement.
Bernie Sanders didn't make anything.
Bernie Sanders is the product of movements that have made everything.
People demanded a candidate who would stand up absolutely and apologetically for organized labor.
People demanded a candidate who would stand up absolutely and apologetically for fair trade,
not the broken free trade model of NAFTA and the TPP.
People demanded a candidate who would vote against wars and against the PATRIOT ACT.
People demanded a candidate...
People demanded a candidate who would march with Naomi Klein and Bill McKibben
to say "climate change is the essential issue of our time".
And people demanded...
Demanded that finally, a hundred years on,
we would get another candidate who would say as boldly, as Robert M. Lafollette did,
that this fight is not about parties and partisanship and ideology.
This fight is about all of us against a handful of plutocrats that would take everything we have.
Brothers and sisters!
Wisconsin progressives,
You demanded a candidate who spoke your language.
And ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters, please welcome Senator Bernie Sanders!
Whoa!
In case you haven't noticed there are a lot of people here.
 Well, let me...
 Let me begin by thanking John for that very generous introduction.
We love you Bernie!
And let me thank my dear friends: Ed and Betty Garvey,
for all the work they've done for Wisconsin and this country for so many years.
But mostly...
On this early summer night let me thank all of you for being here this evening.
Now, tonight...
Tonight we have made a little bit of history.
You may know that there are some... 25 candidates running for president of the United States
But tonight... We have more people
At a meeting for a candidate for president of the United States
that any other has had in 2016.
Thank you!
Bernie! Bernie!
Now...
It is...
Now, I was show something yesterday, apparently the Wisconsin Republican Party has welcomed me into the state
with a billboard
And... The billboard indicated that I was an extremist.
So let me just say a few words to my friends in the Republican Party about extremism.
When you deny the right of workers to come together in collective bargaining: that's extremism!
When you tell a woman that she cannot control her own body: that's extremism!
When you think a woman is a child and can't purchase a contraceptive: that is extremism!
When you give tax breaks to billionaires and refuse to raise the minimum wage: that's extremism.
But our views, which represent, in fact, the vast majority of the American people, are a little bit different.
We believe....
That the time has come, when people in Wisconsin, Vermont and all over this country create a political movement
which say to the billionaire class: "You can't have it all!".
And what we are saying to the Koch brothers, Governor Walker and all those people,
is that this great country and our government
belong to all of the people and not just a handful of very wealthy people.
Now the truth of the matters is, is that politics in a democratic society should not be complicated.
What politics should simply be about
is people coming together
taking a hard look at the problems that we face
listen to different ideas and then go about solving those problems.
Despite what the media may think politics is not a baseball game with polls,
politics is not a soap opera,
what politics is about in a democratic society is people coming together
and improving life for our people.
And today I want to touch on some of the major issues that are facing our people
and talk to you about some ideas as to how we can address those problems.
But the first point I want to make,
and John Nichols has already made it,
and let me be very clear about this:
this campaign is not about Bernie Sanders,
it is not about Hillary Clinton,
it is not about anybody else,
It is about putting together
a grassroots movement
of millions and millions of people,
who stand together
and make it clear that we need fundamental changes in the economics
 and politics of this country, so the government works for all of us,
and not a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
And let me also tell you:
that in order to win this election, it goes without saying,
that we need a strong grassroots movement,
an unprecedented grassroots movement,
but let me say this to you also,
and this is something that no other candidate will tell you:
and that is that nobody in the White House, no matter how good he or she may be,
can address the major issues facing the working families and the middle class
without an act of politically conscious grassroots movement.
And the reason for that...
The reason for that is not complicated.
It is that the big money interests,
Wall Street, corporate America,
all of these guys have so much power
that no president can defeat them, unless
there is an organized grassroots movement making them an offer they can't refuse.
And that is what this campaign is about.
What this campaign is about is creating a political revolution in America.
A revolution which takes on
the greed of Wall Street and corporate America,
a revolution which takes on the reality
that the Republican Party is, essentially, owned
by big money interests and too many democrats are owned by big money interests.
Today, we live, hard to believe, many people don't sense it,
we live in the wealthiest nation in the history of the World.
That's where we are today.
But most people in this country don't sense that,
don't feel that because all of the wealth
is being held in the hands of a very few.
America today
has more income and wealth inequality
than any other major country on Earth,
and the gap between the very, very rich and everyone else
is wider in America today than it has been since 1928.
The issue of wealth and income inequality, to my mind,
is the great moral issue of our time,
it is the great economic issue of our time
and it is the great political issue of our time.
Let me be as clear as I can be:
there is something profoundly wrong
when, today, the top one-tenth of one percent (0.1%),
own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%.
There is something profoundly wrong when, today,
58% of all new income is going to the top 1%.
There is something profoundly wrong
when, in recent years, we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires
at the same exact time,
as millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages
and we have, by far, the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major industrialized country.
There is something profoundly wrong
when one family, the Walton family of Walmart,
owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans.
This grotesque level of inequality is immoral,
it is bad economics,
it is unsustainable
and it is not what the United States of America is supposed to be about.
This is a rigged economy, and, brothers and sisters, together we are going to change that.
This campaign is sending a message loud and clear
to the billionaire class and that is:
you can't get tax breaks when children in America go hungry.
You cannot continue to send our jobs to China
when millions of Americans
are desperately looking for work.
You can't hide your profits
in Cayman Islands and in other tax havens
while we have so many unmet needs in America.
You're gonna have to start paying.
The greed...
The greed of corporate America and the billionaire class
has got to end, and we are gonna end it for them.
But the issue of our economy is not just
income and wealth inequality.
The issue of what's going on in our economy deals with the tragic reality
that for the last 40 years
40 years the great middle class of America, once the envy of the entire World, has been disappearing.
Despite exploding technology
so that every worker is significantly more productive
then those who came before,
median family income is almost $5000 less today than it was in 1999.
In my state of Vermont, and I am sure that it is true here, in Wisconsin,
we have workers not working at 1 job,
not working at 2 jobs,
but sometimes at 3 or 4 jobs,
at abysmally low wages in order to cobble together an income and some health care;
that is not the American economy that we will accept.
And when you look at the economy what you have to understand is that every month the government announces
a statistic about official unemployment, currently it is about
5.4%.
But,
if you look at another government statistic
which includes those people, who have given up looking for work,
and those people, those millions of people,
who are working part-time when they want to work full-time,
real unemployment today is close to 11% - that is unacceptable.
And let me touch on an issue
that is widely ignored, almost nobody talks about it.
And that while real unemployment
is close to 11%, youth unemployment has reached tragic proportions.
Today in America, for those young people 17 to 20,
those kids who have graduated high school or have dropped out of high school,
if they are white - youth unemployment is 33%.
If they are Hispanic - youth unemployment is 36%.
If they are African-American - youth unemployment is 51%.
In my view, maybe, just maybe,
it makes sense
to create jobs and educational opportunities
for these young people.
Maybe we should create jobs and educational opportunities for the people, rather than
more and more incarceration and more and more jails.
Today in America,
today in America, shamefully,
we have more people in jail
than any other country on Earth.
So our job, in fact,
is to create a new criminal justice system.
Our job is police department reform.
Our job is to make sure the young African-Americans
can walk down the street without being abused or worse.
Our job...
Our job is to have the best-educated
population in the World, not the country with the most people in jail.
And when we talk about the economy, it's not only
the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality, it's not only
the unacceptably high levels of unemployment,
when we talk the economy today we have to understand that tens of millions
of Americans are working in wages which are totally inadequate.
And I know that Governor Walker may disagree.
But to my mind, the federal minimum wage
of $7.25 an hour
is a starvation wage which must be raised.
The minimum wage must become
a living wage, which means
$15 an hour, over the next few years.
Now, I don't think it is a terribly radical idea
to say that in America if someone works 40 hours a week
that that person should not be living in poverty.
And, brothers and sisters, a living wage
should not only be fair, it should be equitable, there is no excuse for women
making 78 cents on the dollar compared to men.
And let me congratulate President Obama
for doing something that is long overdue
and making sure that millions of working people
finally get time and a half when they're working 50 or 60 hours a week.
That's an issue that many of us have been working on and I'm glad the President came through.
Now...
As some of you may know,
many of our republican friends are very deeply concerned about family values, they just
they love families.
And their view of family values
is that women
should not be able to control their own bodies,
their view of family values
is that women should not be able to purchase the contraceptives they need,
you know, when I say these things, it really is hard to believe.
Can you imagine?
And their view of family values
is that gay people should not be able to get married.
Now that is their view, their warped view, of family values.
Let me give you another view
of family values, I have
4 kids, I got 7 beautiful grandchildren, my wife is hear, we've been married for 27 years.
I believe and you believe
in the importance of family.
And that is why,
because we believe in real family values,
the United States must end the international embarrassment
of being the only major country on Earth
that does not guarantee workers paid medical and family leave.
That does not guarantee workers paid sick time or paid vacation time.
So let me talk a little bit
about family values, today in Wisconsin or in Vermont
a woman is having a baby, one of the
most meaningful and important moments in her life, father standing right beside her.
But, because that family does not have a lot of money,
that woman will forced to go back to work
in a week of 7 or 8 days.
That is not a family value.
In every other major country
women, regardless of their incomes,
and the father as well, are able to stay home
with their baby, get to know their baby,
in the most important moments of their baby's life.
That is a family value and that is why I will fight for 12 weeks
of paid family and medical leave.
Let me touch on another issue that is almost never talked about at all,
but it is an issue of enormous consequence.
And that is as the result of the collapse
of the American middle class
what we are seeing is people in our country
working incredibly long hours.
Incredibly long.
I go around the country and I look in the eyes of people
they are tired, they're exhausted, they're stressed out,
because they are working, and working, and working. I'll tell you a brief story.
Couple of years ago, outside a grocery store in Burlington, Vermont, I met a woman.
And she came up to me, she said: "You know, Bernie, my husband and I have one kid.
but we would like to have more kids, but I'm working 3 jobs,
he's working 2 jobs, and we do not believe that we can be the parents
we should be, so we're putting off having more kids."
That story is being told all over America.
Today, the American people are working longer hours
than the people of any other major country on Earth.
The Japanese are very hard-working people
we work 137 hours a year more
than the Japanese.
We work 260 more hours a year than the British.
And we work almost 500 hours a year more
than our good friends in France.
What can we say about the French?
Now here's the point, and I want, I say this
in order to put where we are today in a broader context.
When we were kids in school and we read history textbooks,
we saw pictures in those books
of workers out on the streets, demonstrating
100 years ago, 1910, 1912, 1914,
those workers held up these big banners, and the signs, and you know what those signs said?
They said: "We want a 40 hour work week!".
What they said is...
What they said, is "We are not beasts of burden,
we want time with our families, we want time
for education, we need time for leisure.".
That was 100 years ago.
Today, unbelievably,
85%
of working men
and 66% of working women
work more than 40 hours a week.
100 years have come and gone, and we have lost ground.
Now, at the very least,
what the United States must do, and I will do as president,
is to make sure that every family in this country gets at least 2 weeks off of paid vacation.
Now, when pollsters go out, and they ask American people
what is uppermost on their mind, what are they most worried about, the answer always is:
a four-letter word called "jobs", J-O-B-S.
When you have real unemployment of 11%,
youth unemployment over 30%, now is the time
for a federal jobs program to create millions of decent-paying jobs.
In virtually every state in this country our infrastructure,
our roads, our bridges, water systems, waste water plants,
our rail system, our levies and out dams
need an enormous amount of work.
Now is the time to invest in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure,
a one tril...
A one trillion-dollar investment
will create and maintain some 13 million jobs,
and that is exactly what I intend to do.
But when we talk about jobs,
it's not just the need to create millions
of decent-paying jobs,
it is the necessity to end job loss as a result of disastrous trade policies.
You are looking at a Senator and former Congressman
who voted against NAFTA, against CAFTA, against permanent normal trade relations,
and I will do everything that I can to defeat this disastrous TPP.
And when we talk
about rebuilding the American middle class
we're talking about rebuilding the American trade union movement.
There are millions of workers who would like to join
unions today, but are unable to do so,
because of illegal actions on the part of their employers.
In my view,
if 50% + 1 of workers in a bargaining unit
sign a card asking for a union - they should have that union.
And when we talk
about greed, when we talk about recklessness,
when we talk about illegal behavior,
these are just another word, another phrase, to describe Wall Street.
In my view, and this a hugely important issue,
for the future of our economy it is time to break up
the largest financial institutions in this country.
Wall Street continue to be
an island unto itself
gambling trillions
in risky financial instruments
while expecting the public to bail it out.
In my view, and we've introduced legislation to deal with this,
if a bank is too big to fail - it is too big to exist.
When we talk
about issue of jobs or
education or the environment
or any other significant issue,
they all are related to
another issue
which undermines everything else that's going on in America.
And I think you in Wisconsin are very familiar with this issue.
So let me be as blunt as I can be
when I tell you what you already know.
And that is, that as a result of the disastrous Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case
the American political system
has been totally corrupted,
and the foundations of American democracy are being undermined.
What the Supreme Court said in so many words, is they said to the wealthiest people in this country,
they said: "OK guys, you already own much of the economy,
now we are going to give you the opportunity
to own the United States government."
and that is what they are trying to do right now.
Let me be as clear as I can be.
And that is, that as President of the United States I will not nominate any
justice to the Supreme Court, who has not made it crystal-clear
that he or she will vote and work to overturn this disastrous Citizens United decision.
Long-term, overturning Citizens United is terribly important, passing a disclosure law is terribly important, but, long-term,
if we want to see a vibrant democracy,
where people of any political point of view who want to be in public service
can get up and run for office
without having to beg rich people for money, we need to move to public funding of elections.
Let me give you an example... Give you an example of how bad
the situation is today. According to media reports, which, I think, are accurate, the Koch brothers alone,
second-wealthiest family in America,
a family that wants to eliminate
social security, medicare, medicaid,
public education,
and virtually every piece of legislation passed since the 1930s which protect the working families, this one family
will be spending, in this election cycle, close to $1,000,000,000.
And they're job, and what they're money is about, is to elect candidate who make the rich richer and everybody else poorer.
But when you have 1 family spending close to a billion dollars, which is more money
than either the Democratic Party or the Republican Party will spend,
this is not democracy, this is oligarchy, and we have got to end it.
And let me also be clear, that American democracy means one person - one vote.
American democracy means that we try to have the highest voter turnout in the World.
American democracy does not mean voter suppression or the gerrymandering of districts.
I think everybody here knows that we are living in a very competitive global economy.
And that if we are gonna succeed, if our economy is going to do well in years to come
we need to have the best-educated workforce in the World.
To my mind, it is basically insane, and I use that word advisably,
and counter-productive to the future of this country, when we have today hundreds of thousands
of bright, young, qualified people, who want to get a higher education,
they want to go to college, but they are locked out because their families don't have enough money.
And that is not only pulling the ladder out from under these young people who want to work hard and make it to the middle class,
it is not the way you create a growing and vibrant economy when we need doctors, and scientists, and nurses, and teachers and all kinds of educated workers.
But the issue goes beyond the high cost of college and people not being able to get in to college.
Today, we have a situation where we have millions of young and not-so-young people
who are shouldering horrendous college debt decade after decade.
A year or so ago I met with some folks, and there was a young women there
whose dream it had been to go to medical school and practice primary care for lower-income people, exactly the kind of physicians that we need, and that's what she did.
And as a result, she left school $300,000 in debt.
For the crime of going to medical school so she can work with low-income people. Then, I thought that that was
really quite extreme, and then I was in Iowa, a couple of months ago,
and I mention this fact, and a young woman came up to me after my remarks, and she said: "Senator, I just graduated dental school $400,000 in debt.".
Now, that is why, and all over this country young people fifty, sixty thousand dollars in debt
talk to somebody recently spending 20% of her income paying back student debt. People can't get married, they can't get have kids, can't buy a house because of the student debt.
So, we've introduced legislation, which I will push through as president, that does two things:
Number one, it will make every public college and university in America tuition-free.
And, I want you to know, the importance of that concept is not just
for kids in the 11th or 12th grade who want to go to college,
the importance of that concept, is that it will resonate with kids in the 5th grade and in the 6th grade right now, all over America,
there are young kids, who may not know it intellectually, but they know it emotionally, their parents didn't go to college,
the kids in their neighborhood don't go to college, why should they study hard? Why should they do their homework if they're not going be able to get a higher education or get into the middle class? That's wrong!
So we are saying to every kid in America: "If you study hard, if you do your work,
you will, in fact, be able to get all the education you need, regardless of the income of your family.".
And when we talk about student debt it is absolutely unconscionable that we have folks today, who are paying interests rate of 8%, 9%, 10%
on student debt, which they are stuck with for decades, yet they can go out and refinance their home for 2% or 3%.
So what we've got to do, is allow people with student debt to refinance
we've got to get the government out of the business of profiteering off of student debt as well.
And when we do that, we can cut student interest rates by more than half.
Now, when we talk, when we talk about the major issues facing not only our country, but the World,
it is absolutely essential that we talk about our responsibilities as human beings,
as adults, as parents, and understand, that there is nothing more important than leaving this planet in a way that is habitable for our kids and our grandchildren.
The debate is over. The scientific community has spoken in a virtually unanimous voice,
climate change is real, climate change is caused by human activity,
and it is already causing devastating problems all over our country and all over the World.
You don't have to look further than the water situation in California,
you don't have to look further than what's going on in Pakistan, where people are dying from an unprecedented heat wave.
The scientists are telling us, loudly and clearly, that if we do not boldly transform our energy system
away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy,
this planet will see a temperature rise of between 5 and 10 degrees
centigrade, with extraordinary negative consequences.
What that means, is more drought, more floods, more extreme weather disturbances,
more acidification of the ocean, more rising sea levels.
And what the CIA and the Department of Defense tell us, is that when people around the World don't have food,
because the land that they are working on is no longer arable,
when they do not have enough water, this causes international
security issues, where people fight each other for limited natural resources.
As a nation, we can,
as a nation, we must,
lead the entire World in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel.
And let me just... Let me just...
Mention something to you that many of you know know, and that is
today, sadly, tragically, the United States of America is the only major, industrialized nation
that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right.
That is not something that we should be proud of, it is something we should be embarrassed about.
Despite the gains of the Affordable Care Act
35 million Americans continue to lack health insurance
and many more are under-insured with high deductibles and high co-payments.
Yet, despite all of that,
we continue to spend almost twice as much per capita on health care
as do the people of any other nation. In my view,
this country must make two fundamental decisions with regard to health care.
Number one, in America health care must be a right for all of our people.
And number two, if we are going to provide health care,
to all of our people in a cost-effective way, if we're going to take
the burden off the backs of small businesses,
we need to move to a medicare for all single-payer system.
All of you who are here this evening, I think, have an understanding,
about how real change takes place in our country, and has historically taken place.
You are aware that change takes place from the bottom on up.
It's never from the top on down, people on top are usually the last to know.
You are all aware, that a hundred and more years ago, workers, who were working incredibly long hours under horrendous working conditions,
said "Enough is enough, we're going to form unions and engage in collective bargaining.".
And as a result of those efforts we have created a middle class
in this country workers had decent wages, decent benefits.
And politically, because of millions of workers coming together, we passed social security, medicare, and medicaid, and many other programs to help the American people.
Because people came together. All of you are aware of the tragic history of racism in America.
But for a very long time, African-Americans and their white allies
came together, and they struggled, and they stood up for justice.
And they stood up to lynching, and they stood up to segregation, and they stood up to a situation that African-Americans couldn't even vote in America.
And change came about, not as much as we would want,
we know that we still have racism in America, but, as a nation, we should be proud of the fact
that in 2008 we elected the first African-American to be the president of the United States. Most of all things.
So many people stood up for civil rights, didn't happen because of a few,
and when we talk about women's rights, we know that women, the suffragettes,
Susan B. Anthony and all those folks went to jail,
some of the died, and they said: "Women in America and around the World will not be second-class citizens!".
And that struggle continues to exist today.
And then, in more recent history, we have seen gay people saying: "We will not be discriminated against any more.".
And a huge change swept the country, huge change in consciousness, and said that we are going to treat all of our people
with respect and dignity, no matter what their sexual orientation may be.
And last week, a very conservative Supreme Court, finally made gay marriage legal in 50 states.
So, as a nation, we have a right to be very proud
of the successes that we have seen because of the struggles of millions of people to create a less discriminatory society.
That's something we should be proud of.
Right, we deserve a hand for that.
But there is one struggle
in which, not only have we not succeeded,
but in which we are losing ground, and that is the fundamental struggle for economic justice.
I am in the Senate the ranking member of the budget committee.
Which means that I am the democratic leader on that committee, and I want to give you an example,
and I want to speak now not just to the people in this room, but to working class and middle class republicans in the state of Wisconsin,
because I want you to know what  many people do not know, I want you know what your party, the Republican Party, is doing
in Washington D.C.. This is what the republican budget did,
and I know something about it, because I am the ranking member of this committee, this is what it did:
2 months ago, this legislation was passed.
And this legislation sets the framework for what the appropriations committees will do later on.
35 million Americans have no health insurance, only country, major country on Earth without health care for all,
republicans decided to end the Affordable Care Act,
cut medicaid by over 400 billion dollars,
throw 27 million Americans off of health insurance.
At a time when the middle class is struggling
to send their kids to college, republican budget over a 10-year period cut 90 billion dollars from the Pell Grant Program.
At a time when millions of Americans are working 40 or 50 hours a week
and are not earning the income they need to adequately feed their family
the republicans made massive cuts in nutrition programs
for hungry people and for children, including the Wick Program,
which is designed to protect low-income pregnant women and their newborn babies.
And then, after making massive cuts in health care, education, nutrition, and many, many other programs that working families depend upon
the republicans decided to give over 200 billion dollars of tax breaks to the top two-tenths of 1%.
In my view... In my view, when we
reach out, and what this campaign is about is to reach out to working families all over this country,
including republicans, because I believe, I believe,
I believe that the Koch brothers and the republican leadership in Washington has gotten away with murder for too many years.
What they have done, is try to divide our country up
black vs white, native vs immigrant, gay vs straight,
and what they have done is try to divide us, our job is to bring people together
around a progressive agenda that works for all of us.
Go out, please, where we need,
where we need most help, not just in winning this election, but in transforming America,
is to create a process by which people stop voting against their own best interest.
Ask your republican friends at work if they really think it makes sense
to vote for people who are going to send their jobs abroad.
Vote for people who will not raise the minimum wage. Vote for people who will take health care away from their own children.
And when we are successful in bringing our people, the middle class working people together,
we will transform America.
Let me conclude
by saying this: if anything
what I would like to ask of you is: think big, not small.
In Washington the debate is often about whether we cut education by 2% or 6%.
Whether we throw this many people or that many.
Whether we give corporations this much of a tax break or that much of a tax break. That's not the World view we should have.
Our vision should be, that in the wealthiest country in the history of the World there is nothing that we cannot accomplish.
We can! We can provide health care to every man, woman and child as a right.
We can make certain that every person in this country can get all of the education he or she needs regardless of the income.
We can create millions of decent-paying jobs, we can have the best childcare system in the World.
In the last 30 years
there has been a huge redistribution of wealth
from the middle class and the working families to the top 0.1%.
Our job is to reverse that, redistribute wealth back into the hands of working families.
Now, in terms of this campaign,
I am more than aware,
that my opponents will be able to outspend us, they have
billionaire backers, they have Super PACs, they've a lot of millionaire friends.
But we are gonna win this election, be-
We are gonna win this election, because if we do our job well,
if we develop the grassroots national movement that I know we can,
at the end of the day, they may have the money, but we have the people,
and when the people stand together - we can win! Thank you all very much!

the
thank you
thank you
the
thank you
you know we have heard we have had
large turnouts in Wisconsin
in Colorado this is the largest turnout
the
are the
the
there are a lot of people here
you know when we were coming to Arizona
somebody said Arizona
is a conservator stay what they talkin
somebody told me that people are given
up
on the political process not what I see
a
tonight the
thank you all so much
I cannot believe this crowd I just one
of thank you so much
the company
of the president's you are incredible
practices here
tonight gives me hope and gives people
all over this country hope
that when we stand together when we come
together
in meetings like this there is nothing
that we cannot
accomplish a transforming America the
and i wanna thank you land of for that
wonderful introduction
she's a member of the CW a and I thank
the CW way
have a trade union movement this country
what this campaign
is about is pretty simple what this
campaign is about
is saying that our great country
an hour government belong to all the
people
and not a handful billionaires the
well i wont to do tonight is to do
something that we
to rally to and that is just lay on the
table
the important issues facing our country
and determine how we can go forward
so that government represents all of us
and addresses the serious problems that
we face
and the first issue the first issue
well i wont to put on the table
is the issue of income
and wealth inequality the
today
we live in eighty nation
which has more income and more wealth
any quality than any other major country
on earth
that is not acceptable it's a gap of we
are gonna change not
the
if you think about it for a moment
you recognize that the issue
loving Commonwealth inequality is a
moral issue
all we could sense
the perry did finish the sentence
all week concerns to seeing a
proliferation
%uh millionaires and billionaires what
we have the highest rate of childhood
poverty
have any major country on earth
it is a moral issue but it is an
economic issue as well because
our economy can not do well
when so few have so much and so many
have so little the
my Republican friends think that the
CEOs of large corporations
on the job creators you know
do you know who the job creators of you
are the job creators
the
and when working people have money in
their pocket
they go out and they buy goods today by
services
and when they do that they create jobs
but when millions of people
have nothing to spend we are not
creating
the jobs that we need
and that is why I believe that what our
economics should be about is putting
money
it to the hands of working people and
not
the billionaires the
brothers and sisters there is something
profoundly wrong when the top
one to ban of 1 percent own
almost as much wealth as the bottom
ninety percent
there is something profoundly wrong
when in the last several years
fifty-eight percent
all new income created has gone
to the top one percent
there is something profoundly wrong
when one family one family the owners a
Walmart
own more well on the bottom
40 percent up the American people
this grotesque level of income and
wealth
any quality is bad economics
it is unsustainable and it is not what
the United States of America
is supposed to be about the
and we have a message tonight
to the billionaire class
and that message is you cannot
how did all the
you cannot cure huge tax breaks
where children in Vermont then Arizona
go hungry
you cannot could continue to to ship our
jobs to China
when millions of Americans need work
here
the
you cannot hide
your profits your billions in profits in
the Cayman Islands
and other tax havens when we have on
Matt needs that america
that box be address the
and what we are saying to the
billionaire class
is they agree has got tired
and we are gonna dead followed up the
what it is not charged
the grotesque an embarrassing love
11.com
and wealth inequality when we talk about
what's going on in america today
we have gone to recognize the tragic
reality
that for the last 40 yeah it's not ten
years
not twenty book for the last forty years
the great middle-class
of this country once the envy of the
entire world
that middle-class has been disappearing
and I want you to think about this all
love you know now we have seen in recent
years an explosion
up technology and work of productivity
and yet despite that median family
income today
is almost five thousand dollars lasts
that it was in 1999
all over america all over America all
over our great country
people are working not just one job not
just two jobs they're working three jobs
for jobs to cobble together some income
and some health care this economy can do
and much too better than that
let me say a word
about on employment once a month you
read the official unemployment
results coming from
the government and they tell you that
official unemployment is 5.3 percent
but what they don't tell you is if you
look at another government statistic
which includes those people have given
of looking for work
and those people who are working
part-time you know everybody working
part-time
when I want to work full time when UN
although back together real unemployment
is 10 .5 per side and let me tell you
something apps
that we all most noble the scars
and that is the tragedy abused
unemployment in this country
a recent study came out recent study
came out
looking at kids who graduated high
school
and this is what it said if those kids
were whites their real unemployment rate
was thirty
3 percent if they were Hispanic
their unemployment rate was thirty
six-percent
if they were african-american their
unemployment rate was 51 per side
and let me tell you something else in
america today
we have more people in jail than any
other country on earth
that's right
and one of the reasons aside from
a broken criminal justice system
one of the reasons that we have so many
people
in jail is that we have five and a half
million kids
hanging out on street corners with no
jobs
and no education
and it seems to me to make
a lot more sense to invest
in education and jobs for our kids
rather go to jail
credit card for richer the
i wont our country to have the best
educated
people more people going to college than
any other country
not more people jail than any other
country
the
and when we talk about the economy it's
not just income and wealth inequality
it's not just high unemployment is low
low wages all over our country in my
state in your state you got people work
in 40-50 hours a week
not earning the money they need to feed
their families
or put a few books in the back in
washington the federal minimum wage
is seven dollars and twenty five cents
an hour
brothers and sisters 725
is a starvation wage
we have got to talk we have got to raise
the minimum wage
to a living wage 50 bucks an hour
the
I don't think it is a radical idea to
say
there is somebody works 40 hours a week
that person should not be living in
poverty
that's what america should be
and when we talk about fair wages
we also have to understand that it is
unacceptable that women today
make 78 cents on the dollar compared to
the
brothers we have got to stand with our
system is
and fight for pay equity for women
workers
now is
many of you know a lot of my republican
colleagues
you know what they stand for well let me
tell you what they stand for
summer what these what
are republican colleagues talk about
of family values are real talk about
family values
and this is what damian
by family values they mean that a woman
should not be able and have the right
to control her own body I get some great
day believe that women
if you can believe this should not be
able to purchase
the contraceptives they wont
and they believe that our gay brothers
and sisters
should not have the right to marry
those Aug now family values
goes on not our family values
but let me tell you well I think
family values should be real family
values
that support families that enable
love to exist can to exist in families
first we have doctor ends the
international embarrassment
up the United States being the only
major country on earth which does not
guarantee
workers paid medical and family leave
today in Arizona
today in vermont a woman
is giving birth if that woman has
ample income she will be able to stay
home
and the father will be able to stay home
with that baby
to get to bond with their baby to get
the love that baby to get to know that
baby
in perhaps one of the most important
moments
in a family's like but if that woman
does not have adequate income she will
be forced to go back to work
in three days five days seven days
is not a family value that is
that is exactly the opposite a1 a family
value was not as wide
I will fight for and bring about 12
weeks of paid
family and medical the
all over this country
that's right
all over this country we have working
people
thing when they get sick they go to work
and they go to work because they have no
guaranteed
sick time it's time to end not they
provide guaranteed paid
sick time for every worker in america
you know I think we all heard a few
weeks ago that
jeb bush thinks that the american people
jeb bush leagues the American people
need to work
a little bit hard
Worli obviously didn't heal the sad
reality
that the american people already work
the longest hours %uh any major
country on earth our people do not need
to work longer hours
they need hi all wagers and better a job
now when we talk about
the crises facing
our country when pollsters asked people
what's on your mind
what do you think is most important what
people invariably say is
jobs we need more jobs
well in my view when we have over 30
percent
youth unemployment ten and a half
percent unemployment in general
when our infrastructure our roads
bridges water systems rail
are crumbling we can and should
put millions of people back to work
rebuilding
how crumbling infrastructure
hired introduce legislation that would
put a trillion dollars into our roads
and bridges
which would create up to third see
million jobs
and that is exactly
what we have to do think up in america
where all over this country
our people are rebuilding our slippers
now far behind many other countries
lets her out the best rail system in the
world
but what are people to work doing
and when we talk about creating jobs
we also have to talk about stopping the
loss of jobs
because about disastrous trade policies
you're looking at a senator who voted
against nafta
again after the
against permanent normal trade relations
with China and is leading the opposition
to this disastrous trade TPP
trade again
we need trade policies
which create jobs in on america
we did corporate America to start
investing
in america and not just countries all
over the world
now when we talk
when we talk about what's going on in
this country
but we talk about greed when we talk
about
recklessness when we talk about illegal
behavior
these are John some other words that we
use to describe
Wall Street
today Lee largest
6 financial institutions in this country
have assets absorb 10 trillion dollars
acquittal in the sixty percent to the
GDP
of America
after we bailed them out because
they were too big to fail most to them
%uh now a lot bigger than they were
before we bail them out
in my view if a financial institution
should
is too big to fail it is too big
28 cents
and that is why I have introduced
legislation
to break these huge financial
institutions up
now wanna talk very briefly
about an issue which in many ways
maybe more important then any
other and that is that is a result
of the disastrous Supreme Court decision
in the Citizens United case
the American political system has been
totally corrupted
and the foundations of American
democracy
lobbying undermines
what the supreme court said
to the wealthiest people in our country
they said okay guys
you already own much should the economy
we're now going to give you the
opportunity
to all alone the United States
government and that is what they are
trying to do
in this campaign the Koch brothers on
low
the snack 10 wealthiest family in
America
will be spending almost a billion
dollars
in this campaign cycle that is more
money
then I for the Democratic or Republican
Party's
on spending when one family spends more
money than either of the two major
political parties that is not democracy
bodies I look cokie
and that is why we have got to overturn
Citizens United
and why do we need public funding
other elections
i wont I see a lot of young people here
today
the
in our ward our young people to be able
to
run for office if they want to do and
not have to big money
for the rich and the powerful to dole
out
and now that we have a lot of young
people here let me mention another issue
a bit bored and so are you right now
all love you know that we live as a
nation in a highly competitive
global economy and if we are going to
succeed into the future
we need the best educated workforce
in the world
at this moment if you can believe that
this is how crazy it is
there are hundreds of thousands albright
hard-working qualified young people
for unable to get a college education
not because they don't have the ability
but because their family
does it how the money
so 13th Ramon but what it means the sum
kid
some low-income kids a working-class kid
who wants to make it into the middle
class
but can't go to college because his
family
lacks the funds that's wrong and that is
why
I have introduced legislation and will
fight for his president
to make every public collagen university
in America
to your kid great the
and I want you I want you to think for a
moment
I want you to think for a moment what
free public college
and three public university will mean
what it will be what it will be is not
only
helping kids was seniors or juniors in
high school
what it will tell kids in the fourth
grade in the sixth grade
here in Phoenix or Burlington Vermont
that no matter
how poor you may be if you study hard
you do well in school you can in fact
get
all the education unique
and the other higher education the other
higher education issue that we've got to
deal with
is the absurdity %uh millions of
Americans some young good some not so
young
for carrying out regis student
debt
I may not talkin not just 50,000 on a
hundred thousand I talk to young woman
graduated dental school four hundred
thousand dollars in debt
what my legislation would do
is and the absurdity up people with
student debt
paying eight nine ten percent interest
rates
the
if you can refinance your home
at two or three percent there shouldn't
be paid
percent by Justin
and we have also Cox against the US
government
out of the business are profiteering
what's new today
the
there is
a nother issue that is up such great
importance
the Pope Francis in a recent and
cyclical
focus on it and by the way
god bless Pope Francis co-signer
the
you know I think sometimes people think
by economic views are radical
you should do with this guy is so when
he talks about money
being God modern civilization people
worshipping money
rather than their brothers in their
sisters but what he wrote about in his
recent encyclical
is what virtually the entire scientific
community is telling us
and that is that we have a moral
obligation
as adults and parents to leave
this planet to our kids and
grandchildren
in a habitable way
climate change Israel
climate change is caused by human
activity
climate change is already causing
devastating problems
in our country and all OVR the world
we must
leave the world in an extremely
aggressive way
in breaking our dependence on fossil
fuels
in movie
in moving to win so long geothermal
and other sustainable energies
and here's what the scientists tell us
they say if we do not do that
by the end of this century
this planet will be between five and ten
degrees Fahrenheit warm
and what that will mean is more droughts
more flooding more extreme weather
disturbances
more acidification of the ocean more
more international conflict
his country's fight force castle not
rule
resources we have a moral obligation
to leave the world in transforming
our energy system
and when we talk
about rights and when we talk about how
the united states and
many respects lags behind other
countries there is no
issue in which side is clear all then
the issue
Aug health care
today the United States of America
is the only major country on earth
that does not guarantee health care to
all people
as the right
together you and I are going to end
died in Paris vid because
we are gonna pass a Medicare for All
single-payer program
we can do it we can't do it healthcare
must be seen as a rights not a privilege
what we
have also got to do is we transform
America is to understand a very simple
point and I'm the only candidate for
president who will tell you this
but it is the truth and that is
no president none no matter how good he
or she may be
can bring about the changes that we need
desperately need
in this country on last there is a
political
revolution
and what that political revolution means
is that people all over america
have got to stand up and b.com
involved in the political process in a
way we have never done
before
we have got to also is part of that
revolution
have real debate on real issues which is
what I'm trying to do tonight I want you
to do me a favor I want you to talk
go out to be a zone of comfort I want
you to talk to your republican friends
and family members
now here's the boy here's a boy here's
the boy
it is one thing for the billionaire
class
to be voting republican
but there are many republicans out there
you know them these people are working
to two or three jobs
they have no health care their kids can
afford to go to college
and yet they're voting against people
who are fighting against their best
address
every single day
ask your republican friends why they
vote for folks
who want to tax breaks for billionaires
yet they want to cut Social Security
and Medicare
passcode why they're voting for people
you're gonna throw out onto the street
shut down their factories
and move their plants abroad so what we
need to do
is to create a political movement
a political movement which brings our
people
together what republicans
what republicans are very good at is not
talking about
what they really belief you have never
seen an airhead
on TV would says vote for me so I could
cut your social security
I give a tax break two billionaires
but that is exactly wat they Aug
trying to do now how do they get away
with this stuff I'll tell you how
de tocqueville i dont stop by race
by country of origin
by sexual orientation by John Doe
they say they say no whites worry about
blacks they say the native-born
Americans
worry about immigrants they say the man
worry about
women our job is not to divide
our job is to bring people together
the
and when we talk about bringing
one day should together we have got to
understand that today
in america there are any Lavigne
million people living in the shadows
people who are afraid that they could be
deported
to borrow that is wrong we need Capri
had served immigration
rOFLOL the
we a path toward citizenship
for undocumented people we need not to
be dividing families
waiting to be united families are
keeping them
together the
now in our country there is a lock
that we should be proud of we have made
significant progress
in recent years in breaking down many
barriers
up discrimination if we were sitting
here
or in your case standing here
thirty years ago and somebody said you
know I have a crazy idea I think
that may be in 2008 the United States
will have overcome
its racist history an elected
african-american to be president people
would have said that's crazy
that will happen it happen because we
overcame unlock abrasives
plotline auspey very clear while we have
overcome
a lot of racism we have come a long way
we still have
a wall on way to go
it is not acceptable
to me and I know to you that an
african-american baby a male baby born
today
if we do not change things stands 81
in four chance up being in prison
during his life
it is not acceptable to be that we have
seen
young black man walk down streets in
this country
be beaten and be killed on joycelyn
that is not acceptable boasts police
officers I was a male
I was a mayor for eight years and I
worked
with the police what it's a tough job
both cops do it well
but when a police office of breaks the
law
that office of must be held accountable
why
luxury let me conclude by saying this I
want you all to
think big knock think small
i watch youtube all appreciate that you
are living
in the wealthiest country today in the
history of the world
the wealthiest country but nobody knows
it
because all all the wealth rest in the
hands
but a few
so what we need to do is to have a
vision
where it says said well and income
become spread out in a way
then is fair what we need
to do is to have
a vision that says that every
person in this country is it I'll to
health care
as the right
that when a mom or dad goes to work
he or she knows let their kid
in a trial care center where pre-k will
get the best
quality care available
I am the former chairman
of the senate veterans committee an IRA
we'll tell you that in this country
we have a moral obligation to make sure
that every
veteran every man and woman to put their
lives on the line
to defend his country tax payer
healthcare and the benefits they do
we are not good at the fair when I go to
turn our backs
on our veterans
we are going to be a nation
and we are going to create a nation
where everyone
no matter their race their religion
their disability or their sexual
orientation
realizes the full potential other
quality
that is the birthright Americans
I
several years ago I attended a meeting
in northern Vermont
which was honoring veterans who fought
world war to end at the beginning of
that meeting somebody played a tape
video tape
booking at Franklin Delano Roosevelt on
December 8 1941
and I was the day after pearl harbor
and what roosevelt was doing that day
was the clearing mortgage dependent so
do declare war against
Hitler in Germany on that day the United
States was unprepared to fight one war
let alone two wars but in two and a half
years
because this country focus by creating
the best military in the world
produce enough to banks are the plane's
and because we do
we won that war in two and a half years
so I don't want anybody to tell me
that this country when we bought our
minds to it
cannot guarantee health care at all
dog pound me we can't leave the world
in combating climate change what have
the best infrastructure
in the world
dog pound me don't tell me cuz I don't
believe it
there we can create a system where all
of our kids
get a great education
but not if this comes easy
Frederick Douglass the great
abolitionist told us
that freedom does not calm without
struggle I need you
because this is not about me it's about
costs we
to stand together to make not political
revolution
where we create and America
any government that works for all of us
we can do it when we stand up
we can't do it when we stand off and
Saturday
are not is a knot the billionaire so I'm
not gonna have it all
it's our country blacks create dad Asian
thank you all very much
home

America thank you for putting on this
important conference let me from the
slot suggests I am NOT Frank Underwood
talking about is wrenching the hearts of
the american people
consciousness on criminal justice reform
has risen significantly in the last
couple of years a lot of that has to do
with this kind of invention here where
for years a lot of crimes were being
committed that were not being talked
about but now when they get video would
make it on television they are being
talked about and that is a very very
good thing and lose clearly time that we
start talking as we have in this
election about the really disastrous
effects of too many politicians trying
to too many elections by locking too
many people remember we're going to be
tough on crime and throw away the key
we're gonna do this look into that all
of that has resulted in an international
disgrace that all of you know it at the
united states of america today has more
people in jail than any other country on
earth including China which is
authoritarianism communist country four
times our thoughts and we as a people
have to leave this issue right on the
table and that is that people in
American jails are disproportionately to
a very significant degree people of
color and that is the reality in america
today and that is a reality that has to
change too many lives to too many lives
are being destroyed and together we are
going to bring about major reforms of a
broken criminal justice system with an
issue that is on everyone's mind and
that is the continuing struggle for
racial justice in american let's talk
with the facts these are not pleasant
facts but these are facts we have got to
discuss if current trends continue
approximately one in four black males
born today a child born here in South
Carolina today can expect to spend time
in prison during his lifetime
this is an unspeakable tragedy blacks
are in prison and six times the rate of
white people of color are incarcerated
police and sentenced to death at
significantly higher rates than their
white counterparts one in every 15
african-american men is incarcerated
compared to one in every 100 and six
whiteman a report by the Department of
Justice found that blacks were three
times more likely to be searched during
a traffic stop
compared to white motorists
african-americans are twice as likely to
be arrested and almost four times as
likely to experience the use of force
during encounter is with the police
african-americans make up two fifths of
confined youth today
african-american women are three times
more likely than white women to be
incarcerated once conducted black
offenders received longer sentences 10
percent longer than wide offenders for
the same exam crimes
thirteen percent of african-american men
have lost the right to vote guilty to
felony convictions and this by the way
is an issue we don't talk about very
much but it is a huge political
consequence 13 percent of
african-american men have lost their
right to vote these shocking statistics
to say the least but before we even
addressed them we have to deal with the
most urgent and obvious issue that needs
to be addressed head-on and that is the
killing of african-americans by police
or deaths while in custody of tragedies
we hear about screams out for justice
the black lawyers mountable which has
arisen in response to these deaths has
done a needed and commendable job in
raising public consciousness on this
issue the proliferation of cell phone
video has brought the reality of these
deaths into the living room and onto the
computer screen of millions and millions
of people throughout our country I know
you have heard these names before but
they bear repeating so we do not lose
sight of the real human price being paid
Michael Brown
Scott pretty great plan to me Rice
Samuel Duboce cuboid and many many of us
but people must do more than just echo
the phrase backlight was Matta we must
put actions behind those words
will bring about a fundamental reform
that is needed in the face of this
crisis criminal justice reform must be
the civil rights issue of the 21st
century and the first piece that we must
address is police before the killings of
unarmed African Americans has got to
stop nation too many african-americans
and other minorities find themselves
subjected to a system that treats
citizens who have not committed crimes
as if they were criminals a growing
number of communities do not trust the
police and police have become
disconnected alien to the communities
that they are sworn to protect at the
federal level we need to establish a new
model police training program that
reorient the way we do law enforcement
in this country with input from a broad
segments of the community we must
reinvent how weak police America a
critically important component of this
reform is a set of new rules on the
allowable use of force soul force must
be the last resort not the first result
need to be trained to de-escalate
confrontations and humanely interact
with people who have mental illnesses
someone and by the way this happened to
my own state of Vermont not a military
woman called police because her mentally
ill son was acting out soon got shot and
killed that happens all across this
country we also need police forces that
reflect the diversity of our communities
and I must extend into the leadership of
police departments and into the training
departments clearly we need greater
civilian oversight of police departments
and ongoing and meaningful community
engagement we need to federally fund and
require body covers law enforcement
offices to make it easier to hold them
accountable but we also must establish
standards and processes to protect the
privacy of innocent people our justice
department must aggressively investigate
and prosecute police officers who break
the law and hold them accountable for
their actions
we may need to examine when current
federal civil rights status provides the
justice department to protect the people
of this country we need to require
police departments and states to provide
public reports on all police shootings
and deaths that take place while in
police custody and the federal
government should provide funding to
help state and local governments adopt
these new policing standards state and
local governments participate in police
reform should be rewarded by the federal
government
those who do not have federal Justice
funding withheld and very importantly we
must
militarize police departments around
this country look at the television and
it looks like there is an invading army
looks like you're in iraq rather than
looking at a local police department
also got to establish standards and
crack down on communities that are using
their police forces essentially as
revenue generators communities that
receive an inordinate amount of the
local funding
fines and citations need to be stopped
we have to deal with the level of
policing in african-american communities
across this country there is a strong
sense many activists and others that I
have spoken to their PR is over policing
in some African American communities now
I know that some will say that's because
there is more crime in those poor black
urban communities but if we jump to that
conclusion we should examine recent 2014
Bureau of Justice Statistics report
examining the relationship between
household poverty and non lethal violent
victimization which includes rape sexual
assault robbery aggravated assault and
simple assault and this is what it found
that the period studied from 2008
through 2012
people living in urban areas had violent
victimization rates similar to poor
people living in rural areas
core urban blacks had rates of violence
similar to poor urban whites represented
vermont a rural state and I have to tell
you that I do not see the level of
intensity of policing that we seem to
see in so many cities around the country
now of course people committing violent
crimes need to be apprehended tried by a
jury of their peers and if they are
convicted they need to go to jail nobody
debates that we want criminals and
people who are dangerous floor abiding
people off the streets and let me also
say and I say this is a former mayor
somebody work very closely with the
Burlington Vermont police department
that took place
authority of police officers in this
country are honest they are working hard
and they do a good job on the very very
difficult circumstances however we
cannot ignore the fact that the majority
of people living in our cities are
trying to work hard to play by the rules
and to raise their children safely there
are neighborhoods in this country and
you'll notice where mothers hard to
believe in America but it's true
where mothers are afraid to let their
children outside go outside for fear of
gang violence and drugs and we owe it to
those mothers to get dangerous people
off the streets but mothers should not
be afraid of their children being
targeted by the police because of the
color of their skin and that a routine
interaction with law enforcement and in
an appropriate force or even death we do
not want any mobile in America have to
worry about that but of course criminal
justice reform goes well beyond
reforming police departments we have to
rethink our entire approach we cannot
jail our way out of health problems like
drug addiction or social and economic
problems like poverty we must end the
over incarceration of nonviolent young
Americans who do not pose a serious
threat to our society african-americans
comprise fourteen percent of regular
drug uses but all 37 percent
of those arrested for drug offenses from
1980 to 2007 about one in three adults
arrested for drugs in the United States
was african-american know how many think
about this how many encounters between
young people and the police begin with
officers detecting the odor of marijuana
unacceptable to me that we stigmatize so
many young americans with a criminal
record for possessing marijuana but at
the same time not one major CEO of a
Wall Street bank was illegal activities
helped destroy the economy of the united
states not one of them has a police
record
criminal justice system which says that
a not only is a bank too big to fail but
bankers to pick to jail and by the way
all of that the fact that hundreds and
hundreds of lines of young people have
been destroyed because records for
smoking marijuana and the fact that no
CEOs of Wall Street firms get police
records all of this has a huge impact on
people's attitude toward the government
justice upon fairness but in that regard
our attitude toward marijuana must
change i'm happy to tell you the live
introduced legislation which takes
marijuana off of the federal list of
controlled substances it is frankly
absurd under the Controlled Substances
Act that marijuana is a schedule 1 drug
alongside of heroin makes no sense at
all to me so we want to get the federal
government out of the business of making
marijuana illegal if states want to go
forward that is their right to do that
and they should be able to do that
without legal impediments from the
federal government
furthermore when we talk about reforming
a broken criminal justice system we need
to end prisons for profit
introduced legislation to do that and as
President I will make that happen
it is simply wrong for corporations to
be making profits through the
incarceration of fellow Americans or
running detention centers that is not an
area where people should be making
profits furthermore have got to invest
in drug courts and interventions for
people with substance abuse problems our
goal must be that people with substance
abuse problems and by the way this is a
huge problem from one end of this
country that the other huge problem in
my sleep because all you know not a drug
problem we have a very serious problem
with opiates and heroin is a problem all
over america but what we must understand
is that substance abuse is a disease not
a crime and we've got a treated as a
health issue and in that regard we have
got to do a lot lot better with mental
health in america we need a revolution
in how we treat mental health when
people want to get off at Haringey
heroin get off with opiates they should
be able to get into a treatment center
and get the care they need not have to
wait but to use
in addition we need to end mandatory
minimum sentencing and give judges the
discretion to better tailor sentences to
the specific facts of a given case as
you know judges often now do not have
discretion
the federal system of perot needs to be
reinstated for people who are serving
long sentences there needs to be an
incentive for people to make different
choices and earn their way to a shorter
sentence and a path to a productive like
people who committed crimes that i've
landed them in jail there needs to be a
pair back from prison and that includes
a restoration of full voting rights I
don't have to tell you that by and large
we do a pretty bad job in making sure
that when people are released from jail
on end up in jail again clearly you
don't have to be a criminologist
understand that if somebody leaves jail
without job training without education
without money without housing the oslo
that they will fall back into the same
environment they got him in jail in the
first place and that is a waste of human
life and that is a huge waste of
taxpayers dollars and we have got to end
move away from over incarceration there
are a number of systemic issues that we
must address but let me just mention to
them now
first is the disparity in education for
children in poor communities and poor
communities of color in particular black
children who make up just 18 percent of
preschoolers account 48% of all out of
school suspensions before kindergarten
and not just tells you how systemic this
problem is a leading black children be
for kindergarten blacks were expelled at
three times the rate of white children
black girls were suspended at higher
rates than all of the girls and most
boys according to the Department of
Education african-american students are
more likely to suffer harsh punishments
suspensions and arrest at school we must
address the lingering on just
stereotypes that lead us to label black
youth sands bugs was super predators
southern part of my state there was a
principal she's retired was absolutely
fierce and determined that kids in her
high school would not drop out of school
she would personally kill them if they
dropped out of school she knew all of
these kids she assigned menteur more
available 24 hours a day seven days a
week sort of kid out of family problem
at three o'clock in the morning there
was somebody that you could call it a
kid was dealing with drugs or getting
involved in that the mental was there
the truth of the matter is if we are
serious about keeping kids out of jail
if we are serious about making sure our
kids are in school or have jobs yes we
can do that we do not need to allow
millions of kids don't fall through the
cracks to hang out on street corners to
get into trouble down the jail and to
see their lives destroyed we need to
give all of our kids regardless of their
income
shot at attending college now my parents
never went to college
dad dropped out of high school my mother
graduated high school and in our family
which was lower middle class we don't
know many people who want two cultures
there are millions of kids in this
country
parents level at the college they don't
know anybody who went to college and the
idea of getting a higher education is
about is meaningful to them is going to
the moon and that is why I have
introduced legislation and will make
happen as president a process by which
every public college and university in
America
is tuition free import well we know the
obvious reasons why some people out of
school deeply in debt and so forth but
here is a more important but what should
I think about it because it really is
revolutionary
sends is that every child in America
weather in my home town of Burlington
Vermont in Columbia South Carolina if
you do your school work well if you pay
attention if you are serious about
school you will be able to go to college
regardless of the income of your family
millions objects and teaches will have
hope and belief that they can make it
into the middle class if they do well in
school we have to stop the
criminalisation of classroom misbehavior
in this room by the video that we
recently saw of the resource officer
throwing a young girl across the room
right here in South Carolina there is a
pipeline from school to jail that we
have to turn into a pipeline from school
to a promising future
the second issue that we have got to
deal with because all of these issues
are interrelated
have to be dealt with in a holistic
model is the issue of poverty we are
living today
in the wealthiest country in the history
of the world very few people know that
because most of the well almost all of
the well in almost all of the income
being generated today goes to the top
one percent we have 40
seven million people in america living
in poverty and shamefully and this is a
total disgrace the highest rate of
childhood poverty of almost any major
country on earth twenty percent of
markets close to forty percent of
african-american kids now you tell me
the justice of a society in which the
top one tenth of one percent is almost
as much well as the bottom 90% tell me
the justice of a society in which we are
seeing a proliferation of millionaires
and billionaires and yet we have the
highest rate of childhood poverty of
almost any major country on earth that
is a disgrace that is not what America
is supposed to be about and together we
are going to end
Americans don't have ten thousand
dollars in savings marginal wealthiest
country in the history of the world
majority of people in this country do
not have $10,000 what happens the other
automobile accident what happens if you
get sick what I and millions of
Americans age 50 50 50 in the bank they
have no clue as to how they gonna retire
with dignity most black and Latino
households have less than three hundred
and fifty dollars in savings the black
unemployment rate has remained roughly
twice as high as the white rate
rate over the last 40 years regardless
of Education let me tell you the story i
guess im economists'
go to a study for me I asked them to
tell me what the rate of real
unemployment that is unemployment and
underemployment for young people
this country's 17 to 24 graduated high
school didn't drop out
graduated high school this is what they
said white kids 33 percent latino kids
that's an entire generation of kids
graduating high school wanna get their
feet on the ground want to get out of
the house 10 slot their adult lives not
been out there for them so let me repeat
it makes a lot more sense for us to
invest in education and jobs rather than
jails and incarceration will give you a
long speech about how we deal with the
collapse of the American middle class 47
million people living in poverty but
this is what I will tell you we've got
to create millions of jobs in this
country when we do it is by rebuilding
our crumbling infrastructure put
thirteen million people back to work
good-paying jobs another thing that
we've got to do is recognize let us
$7.25 minimum wage is a starvation wage
got a raise the minimum wage to a living
wage 15
access terms not payday lenders
you know the truth is that is very
expensive to be poor you know what I
mean by that
a cashier check your paying outrageous
sum of money not able to get a bank
account in a normal bank we gotta change
those things let me just conclude thank
you all very much for holding this
conference on an issue I get around the
country all these issues that we're
talking about today are on the minds of
millions and millions of Americans not
just african-americans but the entire
community we want to live in a nation in
which we're not spending eighty billion
dollars a year locking up our neighbors
we want to live in a nation where an
african-american get in to his or her
call and not worry about being dragged
out of the call can be found dead three
days later in a jail so we got a lot of
work in front of us but this is an issue
for my mind of enormous importance
it's an issue that we can and must work
on together
absolute confidence that when we come
together this is an issue can be
resolved thank you

today the richest people in our country
on more wealth than the bottom half of
the american population hundred and
fifty million people they know that the
system is rigged when the average person
is a girl hours
wages and yet 58%
executives on Wall Street
over the economic and political life of
our country and most people though in
the nineteen nineties and later the
financial interests spend billions of
dollars on campaign contributions to
force through congress the deregulation
of Wall Street the repeal of the
glass-steagall Act and the weekend of
consumer protection was all across our
country this money in order to get the
government or their backs and to show
the american people what they could do
with this new one
freedom from regulation
well the short show the american people
in 2008 the reckless this illegal
behavior on Wall Street nearly destroy
the American and global economy millions
of Americans lost their jobs they lost
their homes and they lost their life
savings while Wall Street received the
largest taxpayer bailout in the history
of the world with no strings attached
the American middle class continues to
disappear
poverty is increasing and the gap
between the very rich and everyone else
continues to grow and Wall Street
executives still receive compensation
packages as if the financial crisis they
created never happened
dishonesty and arrogance these are some
of the words that best describe the
reality of Wall Street today
president
political
the wealthiest Americans in this country
at the expense of everyone else while
President Obama deserves credit for
improving
this economy
to create a financial system and an
economy that works for all our people
not just a handful of billionaire
medium-sized businesses create decent
jobs
continue the taxpayers of this country
bailed out Wall Street because we were
told that they were too big
yesterday today three out of the four
largest financial institutions JPMorgan
Chase Bank of America and Wells Fargo
are nearly 80%
then before we bailed them out because
they would choose to fail
six largest banks in this country
issue than two-thirds of all credit
cards and woolen 35% of all mortgages
they controlled more than 95% of all
financial derivatives and hold more than
40% of all bank deposits their assets
today or equivalent to nearly 60% of the
GEB of United States of America
it is to risk perspective and the fear
of another bellow it is also true from
the reality that a handful of huge
financial institutions simply have too
much economic and political power over
this country
the Republican trust us were alive today
he would say rain and he would be 100 I
will require the Secretary of the
Treasury Department to establish a too
big to fail list of commercial banks and
insurance companies
fairly would pose a catastrophic risk to
the United States economy without a tax
bill O
dog we need to do is commit to do as
president of the united clicks
something that would have been been
under the glass steagle act
president bill into precisely to prevent
Wall Street speculators from closing
another Great Depression for more than
five decades untold Wall Street watered
it down under president reagan and
killed on the president clinton the
Federal Reserve and the Treasury
Department did Josh banks as a result of
an amendment that I ordered the
emergency lending activities of the
federal reserve during the financial
crisis we learn that the Fed provided
more than six trillion dollars in
short-term low-interest loans to every
major financial institution in this
country including Citigroup JPMorgan
Chase Bank of America Wells Fargo not to
mention water corporations and banks and
foreign central banks throughout the
world
secretary Clinton's we just need to
impose a few more fees and regulations
on the financial industry I disagree
Secretary of Labor robert rice
woes John Wall Street banks continue to
threaten the well-being of millions of
Americans but what does break them up
and resurrect the glass one separated
investment from commercial banking
Hillary Clinton says charge from a bit
more and oversee them more carefully
hillary clinton's proposals only in Shin
and we all the way to contain the
streets excess is so big bull in public
they can't be watered down
politicians to cut it out
dissolution that is so spread is the
understanding our criminal justice
system is broken and grossly unfair
and we do not have these kids and
sometimes even jail for possessing or
other minor crimes but when it comes to
Wall Street executives some of the
wealthiest and most powerful people in
this country
illegal behavior causes pain and
suffering while millions of Americans
nothing happens to them
million jobs home savings book for the
CEO of Wall Street no no jail time no
justice criminal justice system which
room or does not dispense justice
has ever been prosecuted for posing the
near-collapse of our entire economy will
change on the ball
or reaching settlements unfair and
deceptive activities some people believe
that this is an operation that we have
an honest financial system in which
every now and then major financial
institutions do something wrong and
court in my view the evidence suggests
that would be incorrect and ours is the
business model of Wall Street
the role regulatory the likelihood is
that Wall Street get away with a lot
more illegal behavior we know how many
times have we heard them if they have
been wrong but it wasn't illegal let me
help today
major financial institutions in this
country have been fined two hundred and
four billion dollars two hundred billion
dollars and that once again takes place
in a week
regulatory environment of when major
banks were doing illegal active in
August 2014 Bank of America settled the
case with the department of justice for
more than sixteen billion dollars on

crisis in November of 2000 and 3000

free card
not be too big to fail big time
bankers will not be too big to jail

that trust is to make sure your credit
rating agencies do not make a profit
from wall street
credit agencies did not give these
worthless financial products triple-a
ratings ratings
if that works for all americans we have
got to financial institutions for
ripping off the american people by
charging sky-high interest rates and
outrageous fees
that americans of four or five dollars
in fees every time they go to an ATM of

don't need the help flyer in the picture

cycle of debt has gone
millions of some of the most vulnerable
people in this country postal office is
exist in almost every community in our
country one important way to provide Dec
banking opportunities for low-income
communities is to allow the United

banking services
on wall street the federal reserve acted
with the Fed will say both of us today
that fear sense of urgency to come down
unemployment and low wages
to make more democratic institution
responsive to the needs of ordinary
Americans not just wall street has been
hijacked by the very bank is it is in
charge of regulating would be shocked to
know their Jamie Dimon the CEO of JP
served on the board of the New York Fed
at the same time that he received a
three hundred and ninety one billion
dollar bailout from the Federal Reserve
conflict of interest that I will as
president
boxes to be guarding the hen house at
the banking industry will be able to
serve on the boards and handpick its
members and special interest money out
of the economy and parked at the Fed
excess reserves of financial
institutions that are sitting in the
Federal Reserve have grown from less
than two billion in 2008 22 points for
Trillian dollars today that is absurd
instead of paying interest on these
reserves should be charged a fee that
could be used to provide affordable
loans to small businesses to create jobs
will tell you or anyone else can
effectively address crises facing the
working families of this country alone
no president can do it alone
the truth is that Wall Street corporate
America corporate media and wealthy
campaign donors are just too what this
campaign is building a political move
which revitalizes american democracy
which brings millions of people together
black white Latino Asian American Native
American native and immigrant people
enormous economic and political makes
huge campaign contributions they have
thousands of obvious and they provide
very generous speaking fees to those who
go before them has an endless supply of
money but we have something they don't
have and that is when millions of
working families together to make
fundamental changes in our lives we have
the power to bring about that change
not just a handful of wealthy
speculators and now more than ample that
is exactly what we must do to you today
is simple and straightforward if elected
president I will rein in Wall Street so
they cannot crash our economy again
on wall street like the No
thank you all

thank all of you here this afternoon
before I begin my remarks
let me give you a very short thumbnail
sketch of my political life because my
journey here to washington D C has been
a little bit different than many of my
colleagues join mention I was born in
Brooklyn New York 1941 my father came to
this country from Poland at the age of
17 without a penny in his pocket and
without much of an educational I always
think back about bravery was his as well
as many other millions of people who
came to this country with so little my
mom graduated high school in New York
City my dad worked for almost his entire
life as a paint salesman and we were
solidly lower-middle-class my parents my
brother and I believed in a small
rent-controlled apartment my mother's
dream was to move out of that small
apartment and i own a home of her own
she died young and she never fulfilled
that dream as a kid in many many ways I
learnt a lot of money means to a family
and that is a lesson
I have never forgot my wife Jane and I
have been married for 27 years we r for
break loose and seven beautiful
grandchildren and without trying to be
overly dramatic about it what motivates
me politically why I do what I do is to
make sure that these kids and all of our
children can live in a wonderful country
and a wonderful world representing the
great state of Vermont join indicated
the longest-serving independent in
american congressional history I served
16 years in the house and Vermont's lone
congressman in a 2006 I was elected to
the Senate reelected in 2012 I began my
rather unusual political career back in
1971 is a candidate for the US Senate on
a small third party called liberty and I
received two percent of the world not
dissuaded governor of the state of
Vermont and received one percent of all
not be the brightest light on the block
I ran again for the senate and received
four percent of the vote two years later
after governor and received sixty
percent of the vote I thought I would
give people want to break and I retired
from politics in 1976 remembering one
particular going said burning I promise
I will vote for you if you promise that
you will never run for office again in
1981 I was persuaded by some friends to
run for mayor of Burlington the largest
city in our state against the five-term
Democrat democratic mayor I ran as an
independent nobody but nobody thought we
had a chance to win we do not very
remarkable election we put together an
extraordinary coalition of workers and
trade unionists of environmentalists of
neighborhood activist low-income
organizations of women's groups of
college students and that type of
coalition politics are bringing people
together around a progressive agenda
changed my view of politics today in a
campaign which costs about $4,000 I the
people who supported me not on thousands
of doors in the city and let me tell you
it gets cold in Vermont in March
on election night when the votes were
counted we want the working class once
by something like two to one and won the
election by all of 40 boats it was the
biggest political upset in modern
history and after reading the margin of
victory was reduced to 10 goals without
going into any great lengths to your
local office with 11 out of the 13
members of the City Council Democrats
and Republicans in very strong
opposition to my agenda and trust those
of you in this room
think the president Obama has gotten a
rough time for republicans that was
nothing compared to what I am i
supported experience during my first
journal but one year later
of what we were attempting to do and
what we wanted to do a slate of
candidates working with me
defeated a number of the incumbent
obstructionists a year after that
election in which the voter turnout was
almost double what it was when I was
first elected i pretty easily defeated
Democratic and Republican candidates
continue to get reelected in my last
election defeated a candidate from both
political parties 1988 I ran for the US
Congress in a three-way race I came in
second with thirty eight percent of the
vote two years later won election 16
percent of winning with over 16 percent
more than my opponent in 2006 with
retirement of senator jim jeffords and
with the support of them
I one per month senate seat to go to the
wealthiest person in the state of
Vermont a candidate who spent three
times more money than anyone had ever
spent before and I'll say just three and
already very very negative rates I want
with 67 percent of the vote in a 2012
re-election with 71% as mayor of
Burlington my administration took on
virtually every special and powerful
interest in the city and in the state
against the wishes of developers and the
railroads we created a beautiful people
oriented waterfront and a bike path
along the way they Champlain we
developed the first municipal housing
land trusts in the country for a
portable housing we won national
recognition Berlin beautification by
planting thousands of trees throughout
the city and we make major improvements
in our streets and sidewalks we
implemented the largest environmental
program then in the state's history by
building a new wastewater facility for
that untreated waste going into the lake
we sought to use laws which created a
beautiful day casts a little program
after school programs and a team set up
all of which continue to exist today
with the first city in vermont to break
its dependence on the regressive
property tax we made major changes in
Burlington police dept moving in the
direction of community policing we saw a
very active and successful loss program
and Women's Council results for the last
several decades Burlington has been
considered to be one of the most
beautiful and livable cities in America
all of you not only the business
Burlington but the visit of beautiful
state of Vermont 1992 became first
independent elected to the US House and
forty years and during my first year
there along with four other house
members of the Congressional Progressive
Caucus which sounds today it's one of
the largest and most important caucuses
in congress doing a great job
representing the working of our country
one of the first votes in the house that
I cast was against the first Gulf War I
believe that history will record that
that was the white vote as well
foreign policy blunders in the modern
history of our country and also created
a situation where today hundreds of
thousands 500,000 men and women have
come home from Iraq and Afghanistan with
post-traumatic stress disorder and
traumatic brain injury home without the
law with arms and legs and their
eyesight and that is the course before
we get involved in another war we
remember what is really about
I was one of those against regulation
supported by both Republican and
Democratic leadership in retrospect I
think it is fair to say that most people
today do not believe that it was a great
idea to end class and to allow the greed
recklessness in illegal activity on wall
street to go unchecked
written by corporate america again
supported by democratic to republican
presidents agreements like nafta
permanent normal trade relations with
China and other trade agreements which
have cost us millions of decent paying
jobs and have led this country to a race
to the ball I strongly oppose the
trans-pacific partnership trade house
took on the pharmaceutical industry and
the outrageous prices they charge our
people and became the first member of
Congress to take americans across the
Canadian Auto to purchase prescription
drugs there and I will never forget that
trip where women struggling with press
cancel the medicine they need for 110 in
Montreal in the United States by
understanding today hundreds of
thousands of people have to continue
buying them medicine in canada rather
than the local is the chairman of the
Senate Veterans Committee I worked hard
in a bipartisan way to pass the most
significant veteran's legislation passed
in many many years this legislation over
fifteen billion dollars into improving
veterans healthcare into making certain
that the people who put their lives on
the line to defend us get the best
quality health care possible and get it
in a kindly man and I have
wonderful it is to have been the
recipient of the highest awards from
both the American Legion and VFW and I
am very grateful to them for that
someone wanted to learn about health
care and our dysfunctional health care
system I worked hard with representative
Jim Clyburn to put some twelve billion
dollars in federally qualified community
health centers which resulted in some
four million lower-income Americans
lower-income Americans gaining access to
health care dental care prescription
drugs and mental health counseling we
also significantly expand the National
Health Service goal to provide debt
forgiveness for new primary care
physicians the president was very
supportive of these efforts in my view
this program is one of the one of these
success stories of the Affordable Care
around as one of the leaders in the
center trying to combat the global
crisis of climate change won't I hope
past the energy efficiency block grant
program which put billions of dollars
into energy efficiency and sustainable
and working with several of my
colleagues I found the defending social
security costs us and we were successful
in beating back to try to cut programs
cut social security benefits with the
same old veterans from some of the most
powerful people in this country and
that's enough I will continue to make
brief description of political history
let me go to something more important
and that is the future of our country
and what I tell you now I suspect not
too many people who come up here we'll
talk about but as somebody who has been
described as a rugby grandfather to
Schiphol guys on capitol hill I have to
live up to my reputation so I really
rough today in a nation plagued by many
many concerns the most serious problem
we face is the protest growing level of
wealth
profound moral issue is a profound
economic issues and as a result of
citizens united it is a profound
political this is the issue all other
job creation and infrastructure tax
reform health care climate change the
environment education Barbosa
fundamentally impact impacted by income
and well let me tell you what very few
elected officials and that is that given
the incredible power of the billionaire
class over the economic like this
country over politics over me I am
absolutely convinced that the struggle
economically and social justice their
struggle for a strong middle class
struggle for a vibrant democracy in
which elections on not bought by the
wealthy will not be one you know like a
lesson unprecedented grass-roots
movement is the fellow which is prepared
to take on and defeat the power of the
1%
members of congress of those fifty years
ago and many other standing outside of
Martin Luther King small and modest tax
revenue Church in Montgomery I was
reminded that real change never takes
place without trouble without the active
participation of millions of people who
are prepared to stand up and fight for
justice of people who in fact are
prepared to put their lives on line in
those topics the political battle of our
time is not republicans versus democrats
it is not the political games inside the
beltway that preoccupy much of the
media's attention it is not the only
thirty second TBS deployed our airwaves
the political struggle of this moment in
our history is declining middle class of
millions of people working longer hours
for low wages if they are lucky enough
to have tools against the power of a
billionaire class
greed has no end
it is the struggle in american black
white Hispanic Asian Native American
women and men and the income to take
care of their families struggling for
retirement security struggling for a
decent education for their kids probably
by helmet cam broadly what dignity
against the greed of a few on top
apparently want it all of you know for
the last forty years the great middle
class of our country once the envy of
the entire world despite exploding
technology just like increased
productivity despite the global economy
and the increasing trade millions of
Americans today are working longer hours
for low wages and we have more people
living in poverty today that almost any
time in the modern history of america
today real unemployment is not by 0.5%
real unemployment is 11 percent if you
include those workers will given up
looking for work or working time when
they want to work full time employment
is almost 70% and African American youth
unemployment is 30%
law the highest rate of trial the
property of any major country on earth
and despite the modest successful
Affordable Care Act
40 million Americans continue to have no
health insurance while even more are
under heavy co-payments or deductibles
in their trucks policies we remain today
in 2050 the only major country on earth
that does not guarantee healthcare all
people and that is
came to my mind the Occupy Wall Street
movement consider themselves as to why
we are and why they since 1999
middle-class down by almost $5,000 after
adjusting for inflation the median male
work with a $700 less last year than he
did
42 years ago despite an explosion of
technology and productive today than we
were six years ago when bush left office
of course but anyone who does not
understand the suffering in the middle
class and working families about country
are experiencing today and sometimes
that's my perception of capitol hill
here in capitol hill and the rest of the
country I think it's imperative that we
close that gap begin what's going on
with the working families of this
country while the middle class continues
to disappear the wealthiest people in
the largest corporations like doing
phenomenally well and the gap between
the very very rich and everyone else is
growing wider and wider and white top
one percent now only forty-one percent
of the entire wealth of this country
while the bottom sixty percent loans
last then 2% today
credibly the top 10 11 percent now
as much well as the bottom 90% David
Walker 457 billion dollars more wealth
than the bottom forty percent of the
American big the fact of the matter is
over the last forty years we have
witnessed the Robin Hood principal a
reverse an enormous transfer of wealth
from the middle class and the pool the
multi millionaires and billionaires in
1985 share of the nation's well to the
bottom 99% was 36 percent in 2013 down
to just 22.8% if the bottom 90% simply
maintain the same share as it did 30
years ago you would have more than 10
trillion dollars
well is currently the case today we are
doing today which is 11 percent increase
their share of more than a trillion
dollars since the Great Wall Street
collapse
99% of all is going to the top one
percent of people all over this country
struggle they were out to feed their
kids they send their kids to college
childcare worried about their parents
99% generated unless goes to the top one
percent very rich get richer and
everybody else gets poorer
and 25,000 public school is supposed to
be I don't think so that piece of
legislation every piece of legislation
on behalf of the wealthy corporations
tell you you don't know what's going on
in Washington according to media reports
it appears that the Koch brothers are
prepared to spend more money in the next
election that either the Democratic or
Republican parties in other words one of
the second wealthiest families this
country worth approximately a hundred
billion dollars may well have a strong
political presence of the major from a
recent political company that's
developing detailed state of the art
profiles on 250 million Americans giving
the brothers political operation
all the earmarks of a national network
in-house expertise in polling message
testing advertising media buying groups
and automates and mastery of election
law corporate line that aggressive and
usurpation experimentation
operation actually exceeds Republican
National Committee's dollar operation
because they will only get wrong I want
everyone in this room right wing
political power of the two major
political parties in this country what
is the political system
well I think it is not cold democracy it
is cold oligarchy and that is the system
we are rapidly moving and that is a
system we must vigorously
improving economy jobs crisis what we do
we need to rebuild I'll probably a
trillion dollar piece of legislation
roads bridges airports water by the way
support the creation of 30 million
decent paying jobs $7.25 minimum wage
here at the federal level is a
starvation wage we need to raise over a
period of years to $15 an hour nobody
working 40 hours a week in this country
should wear
activity
regulate the six largest financial
institutions assets of sixty percent of
GDP president today you know what he
wants a break them off and he would we
want to break off the United States is
the only major country healthcare
program almost twice as much per capita
it is time for america character every
man woman at Roper public colleges to
try to cut Social Security Medicare
Medicaid needless to say I strongly
disagree
we've got to expand social security not
real tax reform it is not acceptable
that major corporation if the major
corporation taxes will lose a hundred
billion a year in revenue because these
companies money in the Cayman Islands
Bermuda the tax havens for these large
corporations to rejoin America
contribute $100 and by the way my
election campaigns I think the average
contribution $45 and I don't do is fund
raising money and I was thinking if I
was really enormous Lee success
million people a million dollars $100
that would be $300 an enormous sum of
money
one-third of what the Koch brothers
themselves so those caucuses with the
Democrats if you ran with you run as a
Democrat would you run as an independent
right question
getting bolder and bolder and grey or
gray I'll try to think through all these
republican values the republican party
has moved from a moderate centrist party
to a right-wing extremist
once the body of the American working
class
nobody was very few people perceive it
to be the case anymore and people more
and more people all over this country
are looking for alternatives to bodies
that's one of the reasons why one might
wonder what's the negative as you all
know it is awfully hard to run as a
candidate United billionaire billionaire
how do you put together how outside how
you get invited to the base of all due
respect to the media
gotta follow somebody was running as an
independent not to be in some cases
literally impossible to get on the
battle is the third party so those are
the issues we are also trying the
democrats anyway they're really makes
you an independent are you really a
democrat my discussion first victory was
defeating the five-term Democrat
defeated Democrats and Republicans for
many many years this is what I think I
think we have a political system right
now which I mentioned earlier this is
not the party of the white tees up David
Eisenhower and there's no way obviously
focus without I think within the
democratic party you have some great
people you have some really really good
people often don't get the credit they
deserve a mention the progressive caucus
in the house
many progressive in the senate working
night and day for working families so to
me given a member of the Senate
Democrats Republicans so there's not
much question about which caucus would
be enough I want to thank the democratic
leadership in the senate for treating
with very very very decently but to my
mind there's no question but the
democrats of all probable to the
republicans on the issues that concern
if you if you were elected how would you
work with congress there seems to be
gridlock between the White House and
Congress now with that be the same case
if you were in the white house is not
because of the so-called gridlock
every member of congress has a
personality defect and is unable to
communicate with people in the political
party whether people and that hehe
everybody around it just gets this is
what is the case is right now but the
United States Congress is represented
of where the american people out of
touch the American people say raise the
minimum wage tax breaks for billionaires
American people say we have to move
towards sustainable clean energy and
energy efficiency United States Congress
says the Keystone pipeline and on and on
and that is a very important for sure
what happened up a lot of respect and
personal affection
climbed away and his contemporaries and
I think that is a politician one
campaigns of Los only this but if you
would ask me what use major mistake has
been is that he thought that after
putting this extraordinary grassroots
movement of working-class people and
getting elected to the presidency and
then he thought he could sit down with
republicans and negotiate all these fine
agreements he was the only way that any
president taking on the billionaire
class can succeed the only possible way
is to mobilize people to say the
congress guess what this is what you
ought to you all gonna raise the minimum
wage you all gonna create millions of
jobs you all gonna protect our veterans
and I will see you you're not going to
get tax breaks for the rich you all
gonna make college and we are watching
you and if you know who this legislation
you're not going to return to Lowes what
I will say with 100% certain that if we
continue on how the elections in with 63
percent of the people don't vote eighty
percent of which will only get richer
and will continue to dominate what goes
on here so to answer your question any
serious president to watch represent
working mens hostel mobilize people all
over this country to make the congress
they can't refuse to run against them it
would be like to debate the serious
issues facing our country as intelligent
people should be going on
and let me say this again this is how I
always get myself in trouble why we
can't have that if the media that
instead of political let us talk about
the real issues and respect different
points of view but when sixty-three
percent of the people in a poll last
year which political parties control the
house and the senate something is wrong
political consciousness in this country
so what we need simple intelligent
debate on the real issues they see the
American people not more political
gossip who slipped on a banana peel who
said something so I did today but how do
we
transforming our energy system so we can
save the planet from climate change how
do we do with a level not easy stop how
do we do those are the issues that
serious people total transparency people
like yourself should talk about
one person we have in the industrialized
11% about people unemployed today are
you gonna put those people back to work
but are you worried that so few people
have so much political power
those are questions I don't hear very
much about so it turns out I don't know
a whole lot of you know I know what you
know about the rules are quite frankly
from the polls in person at the front
desk I'm gonna close are we getting on
hillary's emails in Washington Dec 02
president and what do you think about
the push by Republicans to have the
federal audit I was involved in dog
friend for the first time in the history
of the united states passed i didnt
tired but during the financial crisis
I think they found out during the
financial crisis six trillion sixteen
trillion dollars was led out to portray
the every financial institution major
financial institution in the united
states and central banks all over the
world
$60 and yet working families today have
to figure out how to pay seven or eight
percent interest rates with their kids
to go to college
maybe we should practice low-interest
loans for working families and those
greedy financial institutions in terms
of that is legislation to live without
here's an example of strange bedfellows
all of which we managed to pass the Fed
doesn't make sense to me
defense in we're running short of time
so try to combine a few of them and you
can jump in cuba pose two wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan if you were president
how would you have responded to the
attacks of September 11 2001 that's one
question and another questioner notes
that you are a big advocate of cutting
defense spending yes this person also
believes your supporter of the f35
program which has come under
criticism is being wasteful so how do
you reconcile that still f35 in
September 11 first voted no but I did
and the reason I did it obviously we
knew pretty good idea
attack on 911 opposed the war in Iraq
and i think is too difficult a simple
things that happen but this is what we
have been Iraq and Afghanistan over the
course of the war in human life as a
very very long at some of my colleagues
help in getting us that was in the
quagmire of Middle East and I will do my
best to oppose right now what you have
is a situation where is an example
Saudi Arabia country control
multi-billion dollar one of the
wealthiest families in the world turns
out that Saudi Arabia has the fourth
largest military budget
in the world now why god's name is the
united states contemplating sending
complex rules into iraq again when you
got the sort of sitting there watching
us do that I think what you have now in
the Middle East is in fact the sole of
his slumping will it be the peaceful
religion believe it will be a nice and I
think it is absolutely
Saudi Arabia Jordan for the countries in
that region to get actively involved in
the effort against the United States and
Western Europe should be supportive but
I do not believe that the United States
should lead

bringing forth but the day-to-day work
that you were doing in terms of job
training in terms of helping small
businesses secure financing and
contracts and the help that you provided
families with counseling when they are
trying to realize the American dream of
homeownership and that just a few of the
areas that you have excelled in a little
bit different than others I am the
longest-serving independent in the
history of the united states congress
and I am running for President of the
United States today within the
Democratic primary and caucus process it
is my belief from the bottom of my heart
I would not be running for president if
I thought otherwise
that given the enormous crisis that this
country faces today
crises that may be more severe than any
time since the great depression of the
nineteen thirties that frankly it is too
late for establishment policies it is
too late for establishment politics it
is too late for establishment economics
we need some new thinking some bold
thinking and most importantly this may
make some people nervous
I think when we have a nation today
where a handful of billion as
unbelievable influence over the economic
and political life of this country there
is nothing significant that we will
accomplish unless we have the courage to
take them on and that is what this
campaign is about that you have outline
for this conference are exactly right
save our cities education jobs and
justice as I get into those things look
first point that I want to make is
perhaps the most important and I do
understand that was some people this is
uncomfortable but I believe it has to be
addressed and that is that the United
States of America two-day
country in the history of the world what
most people don't know that because much
of that well is concentrated in the
hands of a few today in America we have
more wealth and income inequality than
any other major country on earth and it
is worse today than at any time since
to me it is not acceptable that the top
one-tenth of one percent owns almost as
much well as the bottom 90% it is not
acceptable that one family family that
owns more wealth than the bottom of the
american people it is not acceptable in
the last two years the 14 wealthiest
people saw their wealth increased by a
hundred and fifty seven billion dollars
more well that is owned by the bottom
one hundred and thirty million Americans
the truth of the matter is that we can
not run away from that reality income
and wealth inequality is the great moral
issue of our time it is a great economic
issue of our time it is the great social
and political issue of our time and to
get up we must address that issue
a few days ago former President Jimmy
Carter described the American political
system as corrupt he described the
United States as an oligarchy with
unlimited political bribery being the
essence of getting the nomination for
president elected president what he was
talking about is the disastrous Supreme
Court decision in Citizens United
decision which says the wealthiest
people in this country you already own
the economy now we're going to give you
the opportunity to buy the United States
government that decision is undermining
the very foundations of American
democracy what men and women have fought
and given their lives to defend you tell
me what it means when one family the
Koch brothers family will spend more
money on this election cycle than either
the democratic party or the republican
party spent almost a billion dollars to
buy candidates will make the rich richer
and everyone else floral Dr me is not
democracy that is key
that's what we've got to overturn this
disastrous Citizens United decision and
I guarantee you that all of the issues
the candidates have talked about that
you believe it will not take place when
a handful of wealthy people are able to
control our political system now
when we talk about education I trust
that all of you know is that we live in
a highly competitive global economy to
my mind it is insane and I use that word
advised that we have hundreds of
thousands of bright young people often
minorities who have the desire to have
the ability to get a higher education
and go to college but they can't go to
college for the simple reason their
families cannot afford the tuition that
is absurd we need to have the best
educated workforce in the world and not
tell hundreds of thousands of bright
young people that they cannot make it
into the middle class ladylike cannot
contribute as engineers as doctors aside
this and that is why I will fight for
its president to make every public
college and university in America 23
and what that means is that kids in the
fourth grade and in the sixth grade will
know that if they study hard pay
attention to their school work even if
their parents like my parents did you go
to college kids in the neighborhood did
not go to college they will be able to
go to college because the incomes of
their families will not be a determining
factor this will revolutionize education
I think and when we talk about education
but we also have to understand to be
frank is the world has changed since the
nineteen forties and fifties mom is in
the workplace dad is in the workplace we
need a first-class child-care pre-k
in this country in my state and all over
this country working class families
struggling to find affordable quality
child care child care workers are paid
minimum wage that is not how we treat
the most vulnerable children in America
universal pre-k teacher obviously a word
about jobs you read every month that
unemployment is 5.3 percent government
comes out with a statistic please know
that that statistic is only one of many
statistics the government releases are
drops that statistic does not include
those people were given up looking for
work and those people working part-time
millions when they want to work full
time real unemployment is that 5.3% it
is 10.5% it is a crisis and I'll let me
tell you what very few people are
talking about which is an even greater
crisis and ideas
youth unemployment which we don't talk
about at all I ask paul asked the study
for an economic policy and
and they came up with the results that
nobody is questioning let's do this if
you are a white kid between 17 and 22
graduates high school you have a 33
percent unemployment right if you are an
hispanic did you have a 36 percent
unemployment rate if you are an
african-american kids seventeen to
twenty high school graduate
have a 51 percent unemployment rate that
is unacceptable that is turning our
backs on an entire generation and we
must not allow that to continue now when
people talk about but ratcheting up the
United States having more people in jail
than any other country including China
one of the contributing factors is that
we got five and a half million young
people that america in my state in your
states without education hanging around
on street corners doing bad things
it is a very strong opinion that it
makes a lot more sets for us to be
investing in jobs and education rather
than jails and it cost inflation
along with representative john conyers I
introduced legislation that would create
one million jobs over the next several
years for unemployed and that is why I
have introduced legislation that calls
for a trillion dollar investment in
rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure
creating thirteen million decent paying
jobs and when we talk about jobs and
income
let me be very clear to $7.25 minimum
wage that exists nationally is in my
view a starvation wage and that is why
the last week alongside the fast food
industry was standing up and fighting
for dignity I introduced the legislation
that will move us to $15 an hour minimum
wage over the next few years has done a
lot of good things but we should
understand that the United States today
remains the only major country on earth
does not guarantee health care of all
people as a right and that is why I will
continue fighting and introduce
legislation for a Medicare for All
single-payer program guaranteeing health
care every man woman and trial justice
when we talk about the need for all
people in america to be treated equally
and with dignity
we've got a deal with some hard
realities and those realities include
the fact that today if you can believe
it and I know UK
one in four black males today can expect
to spend time in prison during their
lifetime unless we change that
dynamics this is an unspeakable tragedy
and this country can no longer ignore
that blacks are in prison at six times
the rate of whites a report by the
Department of Justice found that blacks
what three times more likely to be
searched during a traffic stop
compared to white motorists
african-americans are twice as likely to
be arrested and almost four times as
likely to experience to use of thoughts
during encounters with police
13% in this is an extraordinary figure I
think not an accident
thirteen percent of african-american men
have lost the right to vote due to
felony convictions can't participate in
the democratic political process now in
my view we need some major changes in
criminal justice in America and is
president of the united states I promise
you my justice will be vigorous in
fighting all forms of discrimination in
every area of our life not only in
police matters but in housing in credit
in every area it impacts minority
populations across our nation is all of
you know and we see almost every day too
many african-americans and other
minorities find themselves subjected to
a system there treat citizens who have
not committed crimes as if they were
criminals a growing number of
communities throughout this country do
not trust the police and police have
become disconnected
from the communities they are sworn to
protect what i was mayor of Burlington
Vermont the largest city in the state
one of the things that we did and I
believe this very strongly as we move
toward community policing community
policing means that police are part of
the community
not seen as a presses in the community
and that is the direction that we've got
to move Cidre bland Michael Braun Rickie
avoid a Ricardo Walter Scott pretty
great to me Rice Samuel most we know
their names each of them died at the
hands of police offices or in police
custody let us all be very clear
violence and brutality of any kind
particularly at the hands of law
enforcement sworn to protect and serve
their communities is unacceptable and
must not be tolerated
we must reform our criminal justice
system black lives do matter and we must
value black lights we must move away
from the militarization of police forces
have all seen on TV this heavy duty
equipment looks like they're invading
the city going to war and that is not
the signal that police should be sending
around this country believes should be
part of the community
not an impressive plus we need a justice
department which takes the lead in
working with states and localities to
train police offices for us should be
the last resort not the first resort
what people who have committed crimes
that i've landed them in jail there
needs to be a path back to prison
the recidivism rate in this country is
incredibly high people go to jail
jobs they have no money they have the
housing and then we are
when they end up in jail
we must end the overcoat oscillation
violent young Americans who do not pose
a serious threat to our society it is an
international embarrassment that we have
more people in jail than any other
country it is obscenity that we
stigmatize so many young americans with
a criminal record for smoking marijuana
but not one major Wall Street exact it
has been prosecuted for causing the deal
collapse of our entire economy doesn't
make a whole lot of sense to me we need
to end prisons for profit I do not want
corporations making money and more money
based on how many people we lost off of
serious a defective warrant should not
be how many people go to jail but how
many people we can keep out of jail we
need to invest in drug court and medical
and mental health interventions mental
health what so many people in jail are
dealing with mental health issues that I
can tell you as a senator I get calls I
think others who was well senator my
brother I'm worried what he's going to
do it himself to other people we
searched desperately for affordable
mental health care we can't find it
that's going on all over america that is
a story that has to change
we have to take a hard look
and the tragedy last month in South
Carolina reminds me of that so strongly
that there are still those who seek to
terrorize and they all terrorists the
african-american community with violence
and intimidation some of us thought that
I had ended fifty years ago but it
hasn't we need to make sure that federal
resources are available to crack down on
the illegal activities of hate groups
there are hundreds of groups in this
country
sole reason for existence is hatred of
african-americans hatred of immigrants
hatred of Jews hatred of catholics that
has got to end of the federal government
must be active in ending that brothers
and sisters thank you very much for
allowing me to be with you and share
some ideas and let me conclude maybe in
the tone that I began
and that is very very difficult days no
question about it but I believe that if
we stand together as a people if we
don't let people divide us by race
gender sexual orientation by what
country we will if we stand together if
we have the courage to take on those
people today whose greed is destroying
America we do that there is nothing that
we cannot accomplish

like you
thank you to lose
and let me let me begin by saying that
we have done rallies all over this
country and we've had great people trade
unionist environmentalists women's
advocate introducing us but I have never
heard people young people
the kinds of introductions and
statements that hurt the night into Sun
and what it tells me and Raul Raul made
this point what it tells me is that when
we stand together as white black and
Latino and Native American and Asian
American when we stand together there is
nothing that can stop us from
transforming this country
and let me just thanking congressman
Raul Grijalva not only for his
friendship with so many years not only
for his coat chairmanship of the
Progressive Caucus by four but for his
decades of fighting for civil rights for
all of how much we all were the first
Americans and then we will protect them
that young man bob della Rosa and rugby
thank those who are young ladies Maria
Isabel Maria Teresa if we know that
wonderful rendition of the national
anthem frankly it is hard to follow in
the footsteps of these young people
beautiful young people make us all so
proud now I asked by the media
why it is that we are tracked turn out
like this why so many people in Tucson
around tonight by 24,000 people are out
in Boston last week
28,000 people couple of months ago were
out in portland oregon the media is
asking happening that we are raising
money without a super PAC
we were all told we were all closed all
of the political experts said that the
only way you can compete it's by picking
millionaires and billionaires and super
PACs for money we said no and our
campaign has received six hundred and
fifty thousand individual contributions
and the average contribution and there's
warms my heart the average contribution
is not two thousand it's not fifty
thousand it is $30 a person
this is not a billion
and when the media ask how is all of
this happening
who is going to respond to the call for
a political revolution it turns out that
the people in Tucson and people all over
this country are prepared to stand up to
Israel set and make sure and make sure
that our government belongs to all of us
and not just a handful of billion
that the american people are sick and
tired of establishment politics they are
sick and tired of establishment
economics the people of this country
understand that almost all of the new
wealth and income being created is going
to the top one percent
and the american people are saying loud
and clear we want an economy that works
for workers not the very rich
and the american people understand that
as a result of the Citizens United
Supreme Court decision you know about
citizens united that as a result of that
decision
our campaign finance system our
political system is totally corrupt and
american democracy is being under budget
before I get into the thrust of my
remarks I wanted to take a brief moment
to tell you what I expect most of you
already know and that is the today on
two campuses in our country one at Texas
Southern University student was shot and
killed and one was wounded and as you
know in your own state northern Arizona
State University in Plex left one
student was killed and three were
wounded now goes without saying it goes
without saying that our condolences go
to the families of those who were killed
in our hearts and prayers go out for a
full recovery but those that were
wounded but we also know that we are
tired of condolences and we are tired of
just press
we are tired and we are in Paris in
picking up the paper or turning on the
TV and seeing children in elementary
schools lauded and young people on
college campuses and the truth of the
matter is I wish I could tell you other
was the issue of gun violence is not
gonna be solved easily but just beat
callers it is not going to be solved
easily does not mean that we do not
address it and do the best we can
I can stay later Ramon like you and I
invite you all up early in the summer
and will come here in the website is
that I come from a slate which has a
history going back to its very creation
of people owning guns hunting doing
target practice but the truth and having
virtually no gun control at all today
but what the people of Vermont
understand is that we need to have a
serious conversation and stop the
yelling and the meaning of all people
involved in this issue
overwhelmingly the american people
understand that it is crazy that people
who should not all guns guns they are
all too well nearly that not only we do
we need to strengthen the instant
background check we need to broaden it
as well
and they understand that it makes no
sense that we have a loophole in the law
so that people can go to gun shows and
by weapons without having to go through
the instant background check people
understand that's wrong and I just got
to church and there are many people in
this country who do not why we are
selling and distributing allowing to be
distributed assault weapons which child
only one function and that is the
killing of people
and people do not understand why we do
not have legislation to prevent people
from buying guns legally what they sell
again to criminals was so close strong
min situation and also what people don't
understand is that in my state it all
over this country they are all people
who are experiencing severe emotional
problems all over this country we have
thousands of people who are suicidal or
homicidal what they cannot get the help
they need when they need it
a revolution in mental health delivery
in this country
somehow if you are involved in an
automobile accident in your hurt you get
rushed to an emergency rule and you get
good care people save you like but if
you are suffering a mental breakdown and
you are suicidal or homicidal you may
not be able to find the care you need
because there are doctors or counselors
available or you cannot afford that but
I think while yes there are
disagreements over how we go forward in
terms of gun safety I think the vast
majority of the american people want us
to goof ball in sensible way which keep
guns out of the hands of people who
should not have that a clutch down on
these senseless murders that we see
every week
and let me also say a word on an issue
that I know is obviously of enormous
consequence all over this country but
maybe more and Arizona than in many
other areas and that is the issue of
immigration reform and let me begin by
saying I know a little bit about
immigration my father came to this
country at the age of 17 from poland he
came to this country not speaking a word
of English came to this country without
a nickel in his pocket and he never made
a whole lot of money I grew up in a
three and a half
room rate controlled apartment in
Brooklyn New York and my mother's dream
was that someday maybe our family would
own home and not have to rent that never
happened she died young and her dream
never came to pass but my parents both
of them were enormously proud my father
may be especially to see his two sons go
to college and he enjoyed the
opportunities that america gave him in
there was no prouder American young man
who came to this country at the age of
my family's story is the story very
similar to many people who are here
tonight and that story is the story of
America it is the story of hard-working
families coming into this country to
create a brighter future for their
children
it is a story
rooted in family and fueled by hope it
is a story that continues to this day in
families all across our country today is
everyone here knows we have eleven
million people in this country who are
undocumented who came to this country to
improve their lives to escape oppression
fleeing desperate poverty and violence
let's be frank today's undocumented
workers play an extraordinarily
important role in our economy
where our workers it is likely that our
outlook cultural system would collapse
and dock workers are doing the hardest
work in this country they all our crops
building our homes cooking meals caring
for our kids they are
fabric of this country
11 million people came to this country
so they could feed their families
escape gang violence and desperate
economic circumstances
let me also be very clear that people
came to this country because they know
that there were jobs and if anyone
thinks that employers throughout america
didn't know that the workers they were
hiring undocumented they would walk
that is the reality of where we
employers were complicit hiring
undocumented workers for low wages
that's the fact of wages alright let me
tell you a little story if I might lack
in 2007 as the senator from vermont I
went to a place called Immokalee Florida
anybody know what is unique about
Immokalee Florida small town near Naples
that's where they grow postal the
tomatoes low-grade tomatoes used by
McDonald Burger King I went there on the
day that I visited just coincidentally
the USA eternity what's bringing charges
against a contract or for slavery in two
thousand and seven people were being
held in voluntarily to work in the
fields
and I saw their working conditions and
the exploitation that these workers
experience and I saw her rent does
housing that they lived in and i'm happy
to tell you that we are hearing on this
issue in washington we made some
progress wages went up working
conditions went off while there are many
Immokalee all over this country where
undocumented workers all be exploited
and when you explore the people who
cannot defend themselves when you
exploit people by paying low wages what
you are doing is creating a race to the
bottom for every worker in america
let me tell you something else people
can have disagreements about immigration
reform but in the year 2015 it is not
acceptable
stooping to racism and demagoguery in
order to win some political goals
it is not acceptable
it is american should be defining a
whole group of people come from Mexico
and calling them criminals and Rick
warehouse for so hard in this country
for hundreds of years to end racism
discrimination in 2015 to that kind of
ugly language
in two thousand and thirteen I proudly
supported comprehensive immigration
reform legislation that passed the USS
said it now this is not what I do not
the provisions of the DREAM Act which
strongly support and which would offer
the opportunity of permanent residency
and eventual citizenship to young people
who are brought to the United States as
children by believe that we should
recognize the young men and women who
comprise the dream is for what they are
american kids who deserve the right to
legally be in the country where chance
that home
Senate bill was far from perfect but at
least it began the process of moving us
in the right direction it is beyond my
comprehension that the House of
Representatives has not yet even be the
discussion on immigration it's hurting a
racism maybe they want to deal with this
issue in a serious way we can't pass
comprehensive immigration reform we must
be as aggressive as we can in pursuing
policies that are you made and sensible
and that keep families together
and this includes taking measures that
are currently available including using
the presidential power of executive
orders when appropriate
while the Senate passed the DREAM Act in
its immigration bill and while the house
has not yet acted I think President
Obama did exactly the right thing there
is executive Lloyd but deferred action
for childhood arrivals daca disclosed
was a good first step but should be
expanded deferred action should be
expanded to include the parents of
citizens parents of legal permanent
residence and the parents of drinkers
our job is to families together not tear
them apart when we talk about issues
facing this country be ongoing violence
beyond immigration we are talking about
the fact that in the United States today
we have boy income and wealth inequality
than any other major country on earth
and it is worse today in America than at
any time since 1928 let me be very clear
there is something profoundly wrong in
this country when the top one tenth of
one percent all almost as much well as
the bottom 90%
that is not what America is supposed to
be about there is something profoundly
wrong went in our results are in Vermont
and all over this country people are
working three jobs people are working
incredible hours in order to put food on
the table and yet 58% of old new income
is going to the top one percent that's
look there is something wrong in this
country went in recent years we have
seen a proliferation of millions and
billions as yet we have the highest rate
of childhood poverty of any major
country are there is something wrong
when in the last two years the 14
wealthiest people in this country
fourteen people have seen their wealth
increase by a hundred and fifty six
billion dollars
well that is sold by the bottom 130
million americans what this campaign is
about sending a message to the
billionaire class and that message is
you cannot have it all
to the greedy is that you get more tax
breaks
children in america go hungry
you are not going to provide
compensation packages to the CEOs of
large corporations at the same time
cutting the health care and the wages
and pensions workers
not just the grotesque level of income
and wealth inequality it is about the
fact that yes we are a lot better off
economically today than we were when
bush left office that's true you know my
Republican friends suffer from the
disease
short term amnesia oil their views the
Barack Obama's closed every problem in
the history of the world yet they took
seven years ago
800,000 people of monks were losing
their jobs they seem to have forgotten
that the world's financial system as a
result of the greed and recklessness on
Wall Street was on the verge of collapse
and they seem to forget great deficit
hawks that they were in the bush we ran
up the largest deficit in the history of
america
but while we are better off today than
we were seven years ago there is no the
truth and that is for the last forty
years the great middle class of this
country has been disappearing what we
have seen in recent years an explosion
of technology workers big fall more
productive as yet most of all people are
working longer hours for low wages what
we have seen is median family income in
this country going down by four thousand
dollars since 1999 what we have seen is
male workers the average male worker the
middle of the economy making hundreds of
dollars less than he did forty years ago
in women making less today than they did
seven years ago
what political revolution that we are
involved is about yet we are going to
create an economy that works for all of
us and not just the people on top
lot talked about enough real
unemployment in this country if you
include those people have given up
looking for work in the media or working
part-time 85 percent it is 10% and now
let me tell you something that very few
people talk about and I did the crisis
of youth unemployment in this country
couple of months ago I asked some
economist to do a study for me and I
asked them to tell me what real youth
unemployment and underemployment was for
high school graduates not dropouts high
school graduates between the ages of 17
and 20 and this is what they told me for
white kids real unemployment 33% or
Latino kids real unemployment 36% for
African American kids real unemployment
51%
you know the words we are turning our
backs on a generation of young people
who want to stand up on their own two
feet they want to earn some money they
want to get out of the house they want
to begin their lives as adults and what
we are saying to them there are no jobs
available for you but let me tell you
something else that we are saying to
these young people today in America we
have more people in jail than any other
country on earth . million people in
jail
disproportionately black and Latino now
it seems to me when you have youth
unemployment at thirty forty or fifty
percent maybe just maybe it makes sense
to invest in education and jobs
there is a promise is a promise I don't
make a whole lot of campaign promises
you got one here tonight if elected
president the United States of America
will not have more people in jail than
any other country
where send our young people to jobs and
school not
and when we talk about the economy in
america today and when we talk about
white people working such long hours so
many jobs it has everything to do with
the fact that wages in America are just
too low as all of you know the federal
minimum wage is $7.25 an hour
the arithmetic as well as I kept you
about the boy suffered a quarter or $8
like 40 hours a week 52 weeks a year and
what you end up with is not enough money
to take care of a family
and that is why I believe that the
minimum wage has got to be raised to a
living wage
and what we talked about fair wages I
hope every man here will stand with the
women and fight but pay equity for women
workers
there is no rational economic reason why
women are earning 79 cents on the dollar
compared to ban it is simply sexism it's
got it
now in the in the campaign season we
often hear a whole lot about family
values republican family values about
families by you all know that when
republicans talk about family values
what they are talking about is their
belief that women in this country should
not have the right to control their own
bodies I disagree
about family values what they are
talking about is that our gay brothers
and sisters should not have the right to
get married
my wife Jane just been and I have been
married for 27 years we have four great
kids and seven beautiful grandchildren
we believe in family values but they're
not republican family values
at the top of my list of family values
for the United States to end the
international embarrassment of being the
only nature country on earth that does
not guarantee paid family medical leave
when a working-class woman has a baby
she should not be forced to go back to
work a week or two weeks after the birth
of that baby and that its while I
believe that our country has got to join
the rest of the industrialized world and
guarantee at least three months
up a family of medically brothers and
sisters when we talk about the economy
what is always on people's minds is the
issue of jobs jobs jobs people on
dissent how difficult it is to go out
and get a job that pays a living wage
well it seems to me that have real
unemployment is 10% if you thought
employment is thirty forty or fifty
percent the United States government
must undertake a massive federal jobs
program to put millions of people back
door
I want to see this country hiring
teachers not firing
I want to cities and towns higher II
trial care workers so that our kids get
the quality child care they need
and went our infrastructure our roads
our bridges water systems rail airports
levees and dams are collapsing all over
this country I want to see millions of
workers getting back to work rebuilding
and when we talk about the economy we
cannot help but talk about the greed and
fraud and dishonesty and arrogance of
those who work on Wall Street all of you
know that as a result of the greed and
recklessness and illegal behavior of
Wall Street this country was driven into
the worst economic downturn since the
nineteen thirties what some of you may
not know you may not know this but today
fool largest banks are much larger today
than they were when we bailed them out
because they were too big to fail
when we have six banks in this country
are showing two-thirds of the credit
cards and over 35% of all mortgages in
my view when you have a six large banks
that have a six equivalent to 60 percent
of the GDP of this country when you have
banks that are too big to fail in my
view they are too big to exist
we've got a break them up
I want to see financial system where
credit unions and community banks are
out there making loans to small and
medium-sized businesses not all wall
street which long island unto itself
overly concerned about their profits
brothers and sisters when we talk about
what's going on in this country today
there is one issue which impacts every
of the issue and that is five years ago
5240 the United States Supreme Court
rules through citizens united that
billions and billions as would be able
to purchase the United States government
what they say what is to the wealthiest
people in this country that said you
guys already own
much of the economy we are now gonna
give you the opportunity to own the
government and the result of that is the
wealthiest people in this country are
pouring huge amounts of money into
campaigns in order to elect candidates
whose sole function in life is to
represent the rich and the powerful
one family in America but second
wealthiest families the Koch brothers
you got this family and what they wanted
to cut social security they want to
eliminate Social Security Letter want to
cut medicare eliminate Medicare and
Medicaid and the Environmental
Protection Agency they don't want to
simply not raise the minimum wage they
want to do with the concept of the
minimum wage so workers can work with
300 bucks and I'll
this family is going to spend some 900
million dollars in this election cycle
in other words what democracy has become
one vote they have one vote plus nine
hundred billion dollars now when you how
one family spending more money on a
campaign the life of a democratic party
or the republican party you are not
talkin about democracy you are talking
about and we got good stuff
here is my second promise to you tonight
and that is that no nominee of mind to
the USS Supreme Court will get that
position unless he or she is loud and
clear
telling the american people that they
will vote to overturn Citizens United
by the way when we talk about democracy
and we talked about the fact that brave
men and women throughout our history
have fought and died to defend democracy
it is important to say a word about
those republican governors and
legislators who are trying to suppress
the vote all over this country that i've
been involved in a lot of election
sometimes I've lost sometimes I have one
but it is never occurred to me to figure
out a way to deny the vote to people who
disagree with me and would vote against
me I regard it as an act of political
cowardice colors for people to not have
the guts to go out in a free and fair
election the think the only way they can
win islamic horrible low-income people
young people people of color to vote and
my suggestion to those people if you are
afraid of a fair election get another
job
anything to say about it and I will if
elected president there will be one law
fifty states in his country and that is
if you're eighteen years of age you are
registered dogs out
when we talk about democracy let me tell
you what I wanna see all want to see
this country one of the highest voting
turnout of any country not one of the
lowest voter turnouts and I want to see
anybody here tonight regardless of their
political views if you wanna run for
office i want you to be able to run for
office without having to big campaign
contributions from wealthy people and
that is why I support public funding of
elections
and let me touch on another issue of
enormous consequence we live as all of
you know in a highly competitive global
economy and if we are going to seek see
now and in the future we need the best
educated workforce in the world that
means that means that with Mom and Dad
go to work they know that their kids are
in high-quality pre-k programs that they
can afford it
public school teachers are adequately
funded
and this is what it also sees it in
american we've got legislation it to do
this every public college and university
must be
it is hopefully think about it for a
second we have hundreds of thousands of
bright young people in this country they
are qualified they're ready to go to
college they can't go for one reason
their families lack the money what we
are doing is pulling out the latter form
right underneath them give them the
opportunity to make it into the middle
class to become teachers or doctors or
engineers or scientists that is unfair
to those young people but it is unfair
to the future of this country our job
is the capture the best intellect so
that we can to say to young people you
can't get the education because your
families lack the money is totally
absurd totally absurd and what we are
also gonna deal with is the absurd
situation today
of millions of young people and people
not so young who are struggling with
high levels of student debt now I spoke
two years ago I spoke to young woman in
burlington vermont her dream was to go
to medical school become a primary care
physician for low-income people exactly
what we need our penalty for doing what
this country desperately needs was
coming out of school
$300,000 it does
all over this country there is a
Deadpool crisis we need deadliest we
need to make sure that people can afford
to go to get this that they could access
to access that came out of school
$400,000 a debt all over this country
people are graduating school deeply in
debt that take twenty twenty-five
percent of their incomes on student debt
now what i don't understand when we talk
about student that how does it happen
that people are Scott with student that
interest rates of 68 10 percent when you
could refinance your home the 23 for the
site so our legislation will allow
people to refinance at the lowest
interest rates they could find it will
get the government out of the business
of profiteering lot of working-class
families
now people so well so great idea burning
but it is expensive their right it is
expensive
going to cost about 70 billion a year
you know we're gonna pay for it
attacks on Wall Street speculation
when Wall Street collapsed in 2008 they
came back the taxpayers of this country
oh please bill of sale will be good boys
well now it's wall street's turn to bail
out the middle class
and when we talk about our
responsibilities as human beings and his
parents there is nothing more important
than leaving our planet healthily and
habitable for our kids and our
grandchildren Pope Francis is rights
debate is over the scientific community
is virtually unanimous climate change is
real it is close by human activity and
it is already causing devastating
problems throughout our country and much
of the world we have a moral
responsibility to lead the world to work
with China and Russia and India
countries all over this world is
transforming our energy system away from
fossil fuel
so energy efficiency and sustainable
energy
and when we talk about needs of the
american people of where we want to go
as a donation I hope that every person
here knows that there is only one major
wealthy nation on earth that does not
guarantee health care to all people as a
right that is the United States of
America that is going to change the
Affordable Care Act has done a lot of
good I was proud to support it but we
have got to go further
29 million people still have no health
insurance and many more are underinsured
with high premiums and high deductibles
in my view we have got to move toward a
Medicare for All single-payer program
health care is a right of all people not
a privilege
and when we talk about where we want to
go as a nation we have got to understand
the world we oppose a long way in
overcoming discrimination and racism and
prejudice sadly and tragically racism
remains alive and well in america and I
promise you my third promise there will
be no president who will fight hard to
end institutional racism in this country
and reform a broken criminal justice
system
the first point maybe the most important
point is that no president not Bernie
Sanders anybody else can address the
enormous problems that we face in this
country and I touched on some of them so
enormous problems no president can do
you know why let me tell you what no
other candidate with the powers that be
in this country that is corporate
america Wall Street corporate media the
large campaign donors they are so
powerful that no president of loan can
effectively take them on and bring about
the changes that we need in this country
to add room lives working people the
only way that real change takes place is
when we make it political revolution in
which millions of people in all black in
white and Latino and Native American and
Asian American gays and straights then
and women people who were born in this
country people who were born in other
countries now what politics in america
is about touched on this is our
opponents are trying to divide us they
are trying to divide those who are born
in this country from those who weren't
there trying to divide straight people
from gay people men or women and I were
antidote is to say that I know you not
deployed we are going to stay together
and we are gonna say yes your when your
super PACs may have all the body but we
have something you don't have and what
we have a look around you can I we are
the people
and a simple political fact and this is
just a fact of history is that when
people stand together in demand change
we never lose we never lose think about
it for a moment
think about it think about the civil
rights struggle of millions of people
coming together saying we're gonna and
racism in America think about women
coming together and say we're not going
to be second class citizens and think
about the environmental community coming
together and see your address the
environmental crises that we face think
about the progress made in recent years
led by the gay community in their
straight allies
when we stand together and we say you
know we're gonna create an economy that
just just doesn't make the rich richer
but it's gonna give dignity and security
to the elderly because we are not going
to cut social security we're going to
expand social security now my message
than I is please do not think small the
big you are living now we could have if
we were poor country we could have a we
would have a very different type of
discussion if you're a poor country that
people would have to say it's too bad we
can't afford to send their kids to
college we can't afford health care
people brothers and sisters you were
living today
in the wealthiest country in the history
of the world which very few people
understand that because almost all of
the well is going to the people on the
top
utopian thinking to say that when we
think big and when we stand together we
can create a situation where every man
woman and child in this country has
health care as a right not your clothes
thinkin it existed every other major
country it is not utopian thinking to
say that we can have the best childcare
and pre-k system in the world
it is thought utopian thinking because
many other countries already do it to
say that caller public colleges and
universities should be tuition-free not
utopia it is not utopia to say that the
veterans the men and women who put their
lives on the line to defend this should
get their health care and the benefits
that they are not utopia
utopian to say that every person in this
country no matter their race their
religion their disability their sexual
orientation should be able to realize
the full promise of equality that

not charged
child
I would
country
60 workers
what people say the issue
it is
going
global

beautiful introductions and thank you
Charleston for their stern
and let me tell you you are a proud
taken a huge relief
to the boys and what the point is is
this campaign is about bringing people
together
because when we bring the middle-class
and working-class together when we bring
white and black and Hispanic Native
American men and women trading ok now
you look for
where we can't stop us from transforming
the country
the american people are beginning to
catch on to what's going on in this
country
sick and tired of establishment politics
tired of establishment economics and
with the establishment media
the people of this country on the stand
one fundamental point and that his
corporate greed in america
that it is immoral that is unsustainable
good almost all of the new wealth
generated in this country is going to
the top one percent and you were taught
together I gotta change that
understand that we have a corrupt
political system went billion are able
to buy politicians will joke
and what we know what the candidate will
say and that is we cannot bring about
the kind of changes that we need in this
country there is a political revolution
and what clearly is that this great
country of ours belongs to all of us not
just a handful of billionaires
but Americans and the reason they don't
understand the reason they don't feel it
is that almost all well and all of that
income is going to be a few together is
to create an economy that works for
working families not just the people on
trial
very very rich and everyone else that in
any time since the nineteen twenties the
issue of wealth and income inequality is
the great moral issue of our time the
great economic you're sure the great
political
together we are going
when the top one tenth of one percent 1
of 1 percent almost as much well as the
bottom 90%
there is something profoundly wrong when
we have seen in recent years the
proliferation of millionaires and
billionaires while the average American
Fork slog around was for low wages and
we have the highest rate of childhood
poverty of any major country
there is something profoundly wrong when
one of the Walton family owns well forty
percent of the American people
enough
and it's contrary this campaign and the
people of america are sending a message
and that message is simple you cannot
continue
you are not going to continue to get
huge tax regs when children in america
go hungry
corporate America and the billion not
gonna continue to send out jobs to China
and other countries when millions here
that's really good paying jobs are not
going to put their billions in profit in
the Cayman Islands to avoid paying their
fair share of taxes
we are saying loudly and clearly is
corporate greed and we are going to end
it
income and wealth inequality not only
impact every state in america my state
of Vermont let me tell you how it
impacts in South Carolina and the last
two years if you can believe it ought
wealthiest people in this country
whattt not a lot of people there well
increase by a hundred and fifty six
billion dollars
while the billion become much much
richer 27 percent of the children here
in South Carolina are living in poverty
what's million children in America and
its South Carolina
those children 11 and poverty $138,000
black 95,000 all-white 30,000 this
across the board and impacts every race
and together we are ashamed of having
the highest child poverty rate
no country which is great
turns its back on children no country
proud country leaves kids childcare
without these housing and when we talk
about basic rights about the needs of
everyone is human beings let us talk
about health care
that the United States is the only
country to all people
why I believe medicare program
insurance companies and the drug
companies and the big money interests
like what their day is going to come
uninsured population almost in half the
number of from 20 percent to 12 percent
a small box and South Carolina
health insurance and legislature of this
as provided for in the Affordable Care
Act
health care in this country
last month I asked I asked them and kids
who are high school graduates between
the ages of 17 and 20 and what their
unemployment and underemployment rates
were
this is what they found if the kids were
white high school graduates 70 20 33
percent of them were unemployed if they
were 36% 51%
more than any other country on her
china is a country much much larger than
china is a communist authoritarian
country pretty tough stuff we have more
people in jail and let me tell you if
anybody believe that there is a direct
connection between five and a half
million people in this country who have
no jobs and school if you think there is
not a connection between that reality
and the fact that so many people are in
jail you would be sorely mistaken
as president building more jails instead
of locking more people
$7
and when we talk let me ask all of the
men who are here tonight just stand with
women and fight
have been married for 27
my Republican colleagues
of America
unforgettable when your baby comes in
the world and is a pretty big day for
the baby as well and democracy in South
Carolina if that woman that family have
decent incomes mom can stay home
weeks and months and long and nourish
the most important time
box if mom's family does not have
sufficient you know what happens that
baby is separated from because her mom
has to go back to work in five days or
ten days
and that is why I will fight to make
sure that every family in America gets
three months of pay
and we are also gonna of America being
the only major country on earth does not
provide pay guarantees will pay
unemployment in america is all but 10
percent of youth unemployment is thirty
forty fifty percent it is clear to me
that the United States government wants
to be a major jobs program to put our
people back to work
South Carolina State of Vermont all over
america our infrastructure our roads our
bridges our rail system water plants
wastewater infrastructure is crumbling I
have proposed a trillion dollar
investment let us rebuild our
infrastructure put
when we talk about jobs create millions
of jobs we must the loss of millions of
jobs to trade policies trade policies so
how has all of america you are looking
at the United States congressman who
voted against not permanent normal trade
position
corporate america wants to buy their
products wants us to purchase products
airtight I'm not a child
what is the most important is impossible
to one issue that impacts every five
years ago as most of you know by a
five-to-four decision the Supreme Court
of the United States
poorly with the Citizens United case
and what they said people in America you
already own much of america
the economy opportunity to purchase the
United States and that here's what they
are trying to do right now
American political system today as a
result of Citizens United has been
totally corrupted and the foundations of
American democracy are being american
democracy is not supposed to be about
buying elections and buying american
democracy is supposed to be one person
one vote
many campaign promises to you right now
and that is any of mine to the United
States Supreme Court will make it loud
and clear that he or she will vote to
overturn
in the world
democracy and when we talk about one
person
fifty years ago congress passed the
president johnson's full voting rights
act and what the Voting Rights Act
finally here's that every american has
the right to vote regardless of the
color of his or her skin
got one of the most important provisions
of the Voting Rights out and literally
supreme court based its decision
republican governors and attorney
generals and legislators began to go to
work to figure out how they could deny
poor people and people of color and old
people the right to vote
you know I have been involved in many
campaigns in my state of Vermont Ave Los
51 many are curved Jimmy never once
tried to figure out a way to deny my
opponents I believe
win elections based on the strength of
your ideas not by keeping
I have been introduced which will go a
long way to make one very simple point
and america if you are a team you
registered to vote
people who have do not have the guts to
campaign on their ideas people who think
the only way they can win not to vote
these people political cowards they
should get another job
that in america today we are living in a
very highly competitive global economy
and of our economy is the succeed in the
future we need the best in the world are
you human tragedy that today hundreds of
thousands of bright young people kids
well done well in school kids who are
qualified to get a higher education on
not able to go to college for one reason
and one reason alone and that is their
families lack the money
that is not what america it is unfair to
those young people who want to become
doctors they want a rise out of poverty
to make it into the middle class and
we're pullin
but it is even if we talk about the
future of America well we need all of
the bright people we can make our
economy strong growth
I have introduced legislation and we'll
make it happen if elected president to
make every college and university in
America through which three
financial today
like my family
their parents never went to college they
don't know anybody who went to college
the idea of going to college is beyond
their wildest I want those kids to know
that if they do their homework if they
take school seriously they will be able
to go to college
regardless
levels of school
and here's the crazy there are people
with food and debt paying interest rates
of 68 10 percent when you can refinance
your home
three or four percent
people to refinance at lower interest
rates
of profiteering
profit from working-class families who
simply wanted to send the college
when we talk about our responsibilities
as human beings as parents as adults
there is nothing more than I can then
making certain that we leave this planet
to our children and grandchildren in a
way that is habitable
scientific community is virtually
unanimous climate change is real climate
change is caused by human activity and
climate change is already causing
problems in our country and around the
world
years we have a small window of
opportunity basically a few use to get
our act together to transform our energy
system or else by the end of this
century the planet earth will be five to
10 degrees warmer more trials drought
flood were extreme weather disturbances
more acidification of the ocean more
rising sea levels and the CIA tells us
more conflict around the world as people
fight over a limited natural resources
we have a moral responsibility to work
with China and Russia and India to lead
the world and moving away from fossil
fuel energy efficiency and sustainable
ranking member Leader of the Opposition
on the democratic side on the budget
committee about national priorities and
about values I want you to know that a
number of months ago the republicans
passed a budget in the congress they
control the house and the Senate and
this is what their budget and I want
everybody including working class people
who vote Republican to know what was
what was in that budget is repeal of the
Affordable Care Act massive cuts in
medicaid the result 27 million more
Americans lose health insurance
republicans what happens when 27 how
many of them how many of them
trying to put food on the table
they found but I'm 250 billion dollars
in tax breaks to one person
was a greedy multi-million working-class
and middle-class Republican support
our job this campaign may be the most
important thing we can do is to get
people in america working people middle
class people low-income people voting
wanna make cuts veterans programs
are we not gonna
also that when men and women country we
are not gonna cut veterans' benefits
and when we talk about our country what
kind of country we know that it can be
we must be very clear that we are going
to end
institutional racism and we are going to
transform
and we all going to trans and make
radical changes in a criminal justice
system that is broken
the good news in terms of combating
racism over the last many many decades
not far enough but if we were sitting
here thirty years ago and somebody said
well you know I think in 2008 people of
the United States overcame hundreds of
years of racism and we will be
collecting an african-american is
president of the united states nobody
would have believed that but in fact
2008 the American people look beyond the
color of a candidate's can look at his
ideas and voted for Obama
of american society no one can deny I am
not just talking about the sixth of a
man walking to class 4a where people
take out a gun and kill nine people that
is literally impossible to comprehend
and I'm not just talking about the
hundreds of hate groups that exists only
function they are only function of
african-americans immigrants or gays or
juice can you imagine a group whose only
functional but in addition to clear them
talking about racism we are talking
about sound for bland Michael Brown
about Eric gone are we talking about
Walter Scott pretty grey and many are we
do not know died unnecessarily and
wrongly at the hands of police offices
or in police custody must change
nobody will raise our broken
things to be done in order to the
community
people trust
a whole lot of police officers in my
community and if anybody hear things
today is an easy job you're wrong and
the vast majority of police offices
tried to do the best they can honestly
and protecting the people but
by the way many of these police officers
are underpaid they have crazy schedules
and live under enormous stress what
police official breaks that police
officer must be held accountable
new rules regarding the use of force to
break up crowds to prevent violence and
what good police officers do that with
us and lethal force should be the last
thing
americans are in jail for non violent
crimes we need to rethink the war on
drugs
I really remarkable young person's
criminal record but the crux on wall
street who destroyed our economy
lot of people around the country have
been talking about and I agree with and
when congress reconvenes in September
introduced legislation and that is to
end the absurdity of private
corporations making profits by running
jails and building
people further addiction drug addiction
are illnesses that need to be treated
drug courts and medical and mental
health intervention
are providing and they serve time and
they got out of jail and they have no
education they have no jobs no money no
housing
associate with exactly the same people
that got him in jail and all end up back
in jail
point of view and it makes no sense from
a financial point of view it costs more
money to put people in jail to the
University of South Carolina
all of you are aware that we live in a
nation in which a handful of very very
wealthy people have extraordinary power
over our economy and our political life
and that's the reality they are very
very powerful and many of them are
extremely greedy I will never understand
how families like the Koch brothers work
a deal worth 85 billion dollars
apparently think they need more and more
and they're willing to the children the
elderly the sick and the poor in order
to become even richer I will never
understand that kind of green
yes yes but there is something that they
don't have we have the people and when
we stand together
in the wealthiest country in the history
of the world do not
create
country mom and dad go to work they know
that their child care in the world in
which all of our people get a college
education
weekend the most vulnerable people
including our seniors seniors choose
between medicine and food
and what's and women who put their lives
on the line to defend us get the health
care and all of the benefits that they
deserve
we can live in which everyone no matter
their race religion no matter their
disability no matter their sexual
orientation
realizes full potential of what America
is about equality for all
the day after the election
sexual orientation

black arrow
thank you iowa
now we're just heard from President
Obama reminded me of something that I
think we should think about and that is
to reach child to our republican friends
and colleagues who are suffering from a
very very serious illness they suffer
from amnesia that 800,000 people of
month we're losing their drops day for
Cox that the world's financial system
was on the verge of collapse and they've
just four cocks that we were out all the
largest deficit in the history of the
united states and the last year of
george bush
so we wear our republican friends well
on the road to recovery and we tell them
what every American knows yeah we got
problems today but everybody knows
thanks to the president and the vice
president we have made real progress in
improving our economy
and we have to spy on precedent
obstructionism from right wing
Republican since all of you look great
work is chair of the Iowa Democratic
Party
our country and for doing today what few
americans are doing on Knox complaining
you are not turning our backs on the
political process and fighting back
campaign and the political revolution
when you see the middle class of this
country
disappearing and when you see people you
know what three jobs trying to cobble
together some incumbents home health
care of your dog Josh shoulders and say
that's the way it is
5 turn raise the minimum wage
dollars
and we fight for women workers when
millions of Americans today do not have
jobs due Friday for a massive federal
jobs program to rebuild our crumbling
infrastructure and millions of our
people back to work
you fight for an economy that works for
all americans and not just the
wealthiest people in this country
when you see when you use that the
United States has more income and wealth
inequality than any other major country
on earth and when you see all of the new
income being generated today is going to
the top 1% you know you know and the
american people know that that is not
borrow not sustain and you demand that
the wealthiest people in this country
and the largest corporations start
paying their fair share of taxes
that here in the United States we have
more people in jail than any other
country on earth
disproportionately black and Latino that
what we have talked to do and educate
should not more channels and across her
ex
when you saw the United States Supreme
Court of one of the worst in the history
of our country
past the Citizens United case
wealthiest people in this country who
are sexually by elections and by
candidates
demanded a constitutional amendment
turn and I promise that no nominee to
the supreme court will be voting to
support citizens united now while many
in the republican party continued to
deny the reality of climate change that
we live in transforming our energy
system away from fossil fuel
and you understand the moral imperative
moral imperative that we'd leave this
planet in a way that is healthy and
habitable for our children and our
grandchildren you are not on the
sidelines of these struggles you are in
the middle of this fight and that is
what our campaign is all about
when I began President of the United
States of America
and when we announced going to take on
the political and economic establishment
of this country very few people knew who
I was not the fact I may have a big
black we worried about 3% of the polls
we had no money we had no political
organization while in the last six
months
yes
hundreds of thousands of volunteers and
every state in this country are working
hard
including 7,000 right here in Iowa
300 Americans and withdrawing some of
the largest turnouts of any campaign
and today I can tell you and I'm very
proud of this that we have raised more
individual contributions than any
candidate in the history of our country
at this point
$30 now the fun begins the great
political experts in this campaign
unless you have a superpower unless
unless you go to the million billion has
the money
Democratic candidate for president who
does not have a super PAC
and we are gonna prove the experts in
this campaign
and by the way just to remember about
eight years ago
all of the political experts talked
about how another Democratic candidate
for president just couldn't win he was
100 its president
well iowa I think we are going to prove
the product it's wrong I believe we've
got one more time
now I my political life is well known as
some other candidates and the remaining
time but I have to talk to you about
some of the difficult choices decisions
that I have had to make some of the
forks in the road that I have
encountered in my career as mayor of
Burlington commodity us' congressman and
as a united states certainly when I was
elected mayor of the largest city in my
state by 10 votes
I think it's fair to say that it was a
shock to the establishment nobody
thought we could win that election and I
was opposed by the entire political
establishment that's the way was I faced
a fork in the road to the special
interests in my city and the political
establishment always stand up and fight
back and that is what we did
we doubled the voter turnout we elected
candidates and we made profound changes
to make her lick one of the United
States of America and I learned the
lesson and then left with the people to
take on big money ordinary people will
get involved in the political process
they will come out and vote and that's a
lesson we learn today republicans when
wet voter turnout is low we win out at
voter turnout is high now after I came
to congress elected in nineteen ninety
corporate America Wall Street the
administration and virtually all of the
corporate video they said you gotta vote
for this nafta trade agreement
break I didn't believe their audience i
voted against nafta I voted against
capital I voted against me with china
and history has proven those of us who
oppose those agreements were right
because in the last 14 years this
country has lost sixty thousand
factories and millions of jobs and let
me be clear about the current trade deal
that we are debating in congress the
trans-pacific partnership agreement is
not now nor has the gold standard of
trade agreements
I did not support it yesterday I do not
support it and I will
in nineteen my face another fork in the
road a very very difficult political
situation it was called the Defense of
Marriage Act
brought forth by republican led congress
and its purpose was clear to
discriminate against gays and lesbians
and the law
gay and lesbian rights were not popular
then I'm sorry to have to tell you that
that bill won by an overwhelming
majority in the House of three hundred
and forty to fifty seven that was not a
political easy now today
summer trying to rewrite history by
saying they voted for one anti-gay law
to stop something worse that's not the
case there was a small minority in the
house
oppose the discriminating against our
gay brothers and I am proud then I was
one of those Baptists
climate change climate change is real
climate change is caused by human
activity and climate change is already
causing devastating damage in america is
all over the world in American history
when almost all Republicans running for
president
reject science and the need for bold
action to combat climate change these
republicans prefer to take super PAC
contributions from the Koch brothers at
the fossil fuel industry rather than to
protect the planet for our kids and our
grandchildren and if you agree with me
about the urgent need to address climate
change then you know immediately what to
do about the Keystone pipeline
this was not a complicated should we
support the construction of a pipeline
across america accelerating the
extraction and transportation of some of
the dirtiest fossil fuel in the world to
me and that's why I have a proposed
pipeline
let me take you back to a very eventful
year and a decision in the modern
history of our country the years 2000
and true the issue is whether Congress
should vote to invade Iraq public
opinion and most of the video while for
the wall and it turns out that big
majorities in Congress or for all the
war as well
overwhelming support in the house and
the Senate for the walk I listen to what
Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld and I said
no they're not they're true
and I was right
riders
joy predicted about iraq turned out to
be right at all but that was a tough
vote I came to that fork in the road and
I took the right road even though it was
not popular at that time
while congress I opposed it time and
time again to rein in Wall straight to
fail to re-establish and bring back to
last season and we need to break up
these huge facts here are just saying
this we as a nation enormously difficult
and complex problems that's the truth
but I believe now and I have always
believed from the bottom of my heart
that yes these guys got the money they
have the power but when people stand
black and white Hispanic
straight young men and women game
when we stand there is nothing that we
cannot accomplish and I pledge to you
that every day I will fight for the
public interest not the corporate
interests of american society where the
ok what black or Latino full working
class just be cause politically
expedient at a given the republicans
that their reactionary agenda for the
billion but not for ordinary Americans
and we are going to defeat down thank
you all very much

Thank you. Iowa, thank you. Nine months ago,
we came to this beautiful state. We had no
political organization; we had no money; no
name recognition. And we were taking on the
most powerful political organization in the
United States of America.
And tonight while the results are still not
known, it looks like we are in a virtual tie.
And while the results are still not complete,
it looks like we'll have half of the Iowa
delegates. I want to take this opportunity
to congratulate Secretary Clinton, somebody
-- yep -- and her organization for waging
a very vigorous campaign.
And I want to thank Governor O'Malley. It's
never easy to lose. I've lost more than one
campaign. But he should know that he contributed
a whole lot to the dialogue, that he ran an
issue-oriented campaign, and he won the respect
of the American people... If I think about
what happened tonight, I think the people
of Iowa have sent a very profound message
to the political establishment, to the economic
establishment, and, by the way, to the media
establishment.
...Given the enormous crises facing our country,
it is just too late for establishment politics
and establishment economics. What the American
people have said — and by the way, I hear
this not just from progressives, I hear it
from conservatives, I hear it from moderates
— that is: 'We can no longer continue to
have a corrupt campaign finance system.' 
I am the former chairman of the Senate veteran's
committee. In that capacity, not only have
I worked hard to try to protect the interest
of our veterans, I've had the privilege of
meeting so many, men and women, who put their
lives on the line to defend us and protect
our way of life.
And what they were protecting is an American
democracy of: One person, one vote. Not billionaires
buying elections. I am overwhelmed, and I
am moved by the fact that millions of people
throughout this country have helped volunteer
in our campaign, that three -- we have received
in this campaign 3.5 million individual contributions.
People who went to BernieSanders.com. And
you know what the average contribution was?
It was $27!
We do not represent the interests of the billionaire
class, Wall Street or corporate America. We
don't want their money. We will -- and I am
very proud to tell you, we are the only candidate
on the Democratic side without a super PAC.
And the reason that we have done so well here
in Iowa, the reason I believe we're going
to do so well in New Hampshire, and in the
other states that follow, the reason is, the
American people are saying, 'no to a rigged
economy.' They no longer want to see an economy
in which the average American works longer
hours for low wages while almost all new income
and wealth is going to the top 1%.
What the American people understand is this
country was based and is based on fairness.
It is not fair when the top 1/10th of 1% today
owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%.
It is not fair when the 20 wealthiest people
in this country own more wealth than the bottom
half of America. So you guys ready for a radical
idea? Well, so is America. And that radical
idea is, we are going to create an economy
that works for working families not just the
billionaire class.
And when millions of our people are working
for starvation wages, we are going to raise
the minimum wage to $15 an hour. And, yes,
we are going to have pay equity for women.
I've been all over this state of Iowa: We
have spoken to some 70,000 people, and in
meeting after meeting, I hear people standing
up and, they say: 'Bernie, I went to college.
I graduated college — now I am 60, 80, 90
thousand dollars in debt. That is crazy. That
is crazy. They want to get a decent education;
they should not be punished.
That is why I believe in the year 2016, public
colleges and universities should be tuition
free. And then my critics say, well, Bernie,
that's a great idea, all this free stuff,
how are you going to pay for it? I will tell
you how we will pay for it, we are going to
impose a tax on Wall Street speculation. The
greed, the recklessness and the illegal behavior
of Wall Street drove this economy to its knees.
The American people bailed out Wall Street,
now it's Wall Street's time to help the middle
class. And when we talk about transforming
America. We will end the disgrace of having
more people in jail than any other country.
Disproportionately African-American and Latino.
What we are going to do is provide jobs and
education for our kids not more jails and
incarceration. I'll tell you something that
really does astound me. I'm on the senate
energy committee — on the senate environmental
committee — I have talked to scientists
all over the world. The debate is over: Climate
change is real. And we have a moral responsibility
to work with countries throughout the world
to transform our energy system away from fossil
fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable
energy.
What amazes me, what totally amazes me, is
that we have not one Republican candidate
for president prepared to come up and tell
us, and agree with what virtually all scientists
agree with, and you know why they are not
prepared to do that? Because on the day that
they do acknowledge the reality of climate
change and call for change, you know what
happens? They're going to lose their campaign
funds from the Koch brothers and the fossil
fuel (industry) ...
So I say to the Republicans, stop worrying
about your campaign funds from big oil or
the Koch brothers worry about the planet you're
going to be leaving your children and your
grandchildren. Now, I have been criticized
during this campaign for many, many things.
Every single day. That's okay. That's okay.
But let me repeat what I believe. I believe
that at a time when every major country on
Earth guarantees health care to all people
as a right, that I believe that we should
do the same in the United States of America.
So for all of my critics out there in the
Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post
and in corporate America, wherever you may
be, let me tell you straight up, yes, I believe
that health care is a right, not a privilege!
And that is why I believe in a Medicare for
all single payer program which will not only
guarantee health care to all, it will not
only end the pharmaceutical ripoff of the
American people but it will save the middle
class family, the average middle-class family
thousands of dollars a year in health care
costs.
Let me conclude by saying what no other candidate
for president will tell you. And that is that
no president, not Bernie Sanders, not anybody
else, will be able to bring about the changes
that the working families and the middle class
of this country, that our children, that the
seniors, our seniors deserve. No one president
can do it because the powers that be, Wall
Street with their endless supply of money,
corporate America, the large campaign donors
are so powerful that no president can do what
has to be done alone. And that is why -- and
that is why what Iowa has begun tonight is
a political revolution.
A political revolution that says when millions
of people come together, including those who've
given up on the political process, they're
so dismayed and so frustrated with what goes
on in Washington, with young people who before
had never been involved in the political process,
when young people and working people and seniors
begin to stand up and say loudly and clearly,
enough is enough, that our government, the
government of our great country belongs to
all of us and not just a handful of billionaires,
when that happens we will transform this country.
Thank you all very much.

close relations I thank her for her call
and I congratulate her and her
supporters with a vigorous campaign
to thank the many many thousands of
volunteers here in the granite state
made phone calls and knocked on a heck
of a lot of doors energy thank you all
great campaign
we have sent the message that will echo
from Wall Street to Washington from
Maine to California
the government of our great country
belongs to all of the people and not
just a handful of wealthy campaign
contributors and they're super PACs
months ago we began our campaign here in
new hampshire we had no campaign
organization we had no money and we were
taking on the most powerful political
organization in the United States of
America with what appears to be a
record-breaking voter turnout
and are safe
August energy and the excitement that
the democratic party will need to
succeed in November
in terms of an enthusiastic and arrivals
electorate people came out in large
numbers that is what will happen all
over
Democrats and progressives win when
voter turnout is high when people are
demoralized and voter turnout is low
we serve notice to the political and
economic establishment of this country
that the american people will not
continue to accept a corrupt campaign
finances and we will not accept a rigged
economy in which ordinary Americans work
for low wages while only in Commonwealth
goes to the top one percent
take this opportunity to congratulate
Secretary Clinton and her organization
its supporters who waging a vigorous
campaign I hope that in the days ahead
we can continue to wage a strong
issue-oriented campaign and bring
we all remember and this is a message
not just to our opponents but to those
who support me as well that we will need
to come together in a few months and
unite this party and their slaves
shouldn't because the right wing
republicans we oppose must not be
allowed to gain the president
remember the last time Republicans
occupied the White House their
trickle-down economic policies drove us
into the worst economic downturn since
the depression of the nineteen thirties
though we will not allow huge tax breaks
for billionaires
packed huge cuts to Social Security
federal Medicare Medicaid and education
back into the white house a political
party which is sold the whole to the
fossil fuel industry that they cannot
even acknowledge the scientific reality
of climate change
Hampshire have sent a profound message
to the political establishment economic
establishment and by the way to the
media establishment
same old establishment politics and
establishment economics people want real
change
I hear this not just for progressives
but for conservatives and moderates is
that we can no longer continue to have a
campaign finance system in which wall
street and the billionaire class are
able to buy elections
political view maybe understand that
that is not what democracy is about that
is what I'm talking about
we will allow them to continue
and I do not want a superclass
overwhelms I am deeply moved from more
than I can express in words by the fact
that our campaigns financial support
comes from more than one million
Americans have made more than three
point seven million individual
contributions
than any candidate in the history of the
United States
up until this point it election
average contribution was seven
going tonight
city to hold a fundraiser on wall street
I'm going to hold a fundraiser right
here right now
across America please go to Bernie
Sanders dot com and contribute
raise the funds we need whether it's 10
bucks or twenty bucks or 50 bucks how
was raised the money we need to take the
fight to South Carolina and the stakes
pretty quick
American people understand is that our
great country was based on a simple
principle and that principle various let
me be very clear it is not fair when we
have more income and wealth inequality
today that almost any major country on
earth and when the top one-tenth of one
percent now almost as much well as the
bottom 90% that's not so
20 wealthiest people in this country now
own more wealth than the bottom half of
the american people
ready for a radical idea and economy
and when they should wages we've got a
raise
yes we are going to make public colleges
and universities 23
of Americans struggling with horrendous
levels of student debt we are going to
substantially ease the burden
people should not be financially
distressed for decades for the crime the
crime of trying to get higher education
that's absurd
my critics say you know bernie is a
great idea until all this free stuff how
you're going to pay for it I will tell
you how it go to pay for it
going to impose a tax on Wall Street
speculation
recklessly and the illegal behavior of
Wall Street
our own economy two weeks DS the
American people bailed out Wall Street
now it's wall street's time to help the
middle class
America it means ending the disgrace of
this country having more people in jail
than any other country in the world
disproportionately african-american and
Latino
are we going to fight and institutional
racism and a broken criminal justice
jobs and education for our young people
not journals and incarceration
is a member of the energy committee in
the senate and the Environmental
Committee the debate is over climate
change is real
and it is already causing devastating
problems in this country and around the
world we have a moral responsibility to
work with countries throughout the world
to transform our energy system away from
fossil fuel to energy efficiency and
sustainable energy
criticized during this campaign for many
many things every single day that's ok
it's alright throwing everything at me
except the kitchen sink and I have the
feeling that kitchen see is coming
pretty soon as well
is thinking big not small it's about
having the courage to reject the status
quo
when every major country on earth
guarantees healthcare to all of their
people we should be doing the same in
our great country President Obama's
leadership the Affordable Care Act has
been an important step forward
no question about it but we can and must
do that and even greater with large
deductibles and co-payments we should
not be paying by fall the highest prices
in the world for prescription drugs at a
time
listen to this when the top three drug
companies in this country made 45
billion dollars in profit last year
and let me tell you something when we
make it to the white house
pharmaceutical industry will continue to
report we continue to spend far from
capitol then do the people of any other
nation all of whom guarantee health care
to all of the people and that is why I
believe in a Medicare for All
single-payer program
but will save the average middle-class
family thousands of dollars a year in
health care costs friends we all know
that we live in a dangerous and complex
world as President I will defend this
nation but I will do it responsibly i
voted against the war in Iraq
go right
votes
combating terrorists who would do us
home we cannot and should not be the
policeman of the world should we bear
the burden of fighting terrorism alone
in the middle east United States must be
part of an international coalition
sustained by nations in the region there
have the means to protect themselves
together we must it will destroy Isis
what we should do it in a way that does
not good
our young men and women in the military
into perpetual warfare in the quiet
fix our broken immigration system that
divides families and create a path
toward citizenship
hard-working people
and that's received so that people can
live in dignity
crumbling infrastructure and when we do
that we create millions of decent paying
jobs pursue the fight for women's rights
for gay rights for disability rights
stronger and stronger opposition protect
the right of a woman to control our own
body
protect the men and women who serve our
nation in uniform and protect our
veterans to defend
we must tell the billionaire class in
the 1% that they cannot have it all at a
time of massive wealth and income
inequality the wealthiest people and
largest corporations in this country
will start paying their fair share of
taxes
I am the son of a Polish immigrants came
to this country speaking no English and
having no money
my father worked every day of his life a
whole lot my mom and dad and brother I
grew up in a small three and a half room
rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn
New York always dream of moving out of
that apartment getting a home of our own
but you never realize the truth is that
neither one of my parents could ever
dream would be here tonight
standing before you as a candidate for
president of the United States
and this is the promise we must keep
alive for future generations what began
last week along with voters here in new
hampshire confirm tonight is nothing
short of the beginning of a political
revolution
of our people together it will bring
together working people given up on the
political process it will bring young
people in the political process he knows
Asian Americans Native Americans
female and people who immigrated here
and clearly that the government of our
songs to all of us not just a few
wealthy campaign contributors this
campaign is about that is what the
political revolution is about solo
Hampshire thank you again and now it's
odd
South Carolina up FBI

lives
this afternoon
political revolution contributed $25 $50
campaign raises money $25 at a time
around some rich person's dining room
living room where people are putting in
a hundred thousand dollars into a super
PAC this is a peoples meeting at the
only nine billion major candidate who
does not have a super PAC
I do not represent the agenda of the
billionaire class or corporate America I
don't want to I don't need their money
is about is just what we're doing right
now
last night just to give you an example
we had some 3,500 house bodies all over
america
I am told told the LA with 1,600 people
are all over the country we had 800,000
people coming out over 650,000 people
need individual contributions averaging
$30 apiece
a result of last night's debate I am
told that we have raised two million
$35
what I raised right now there are many
London's who believe that the only way a
candidate to run a successful campaign
to have a super PAC
down on one's needs before the
millionaires and billionaires big damper
money and what we are showing years we
can run a people-oriented campaign
funded by the pool
country we had a great rally here a few
months ago and I like in a sense the god
knows how many thousands of people one
guy came up to me you know what I like
about what you're doing is you're
treating us as if we were intelligent
human beings
campaign is about about demanding that
all of us and the media start talking
about the real issues facing this time
I slipped on a banana peel leaving here
with me in the front page but when we
talk about the great crises facing this
country to get media attention for a lot
of obvious reasons and if I was standing
here tonight and making some vicious
attack against Hillary Clinton or
anybody else about why the middle class
is disappearing and almost all new
income and wealth is going to the top
one percent not a big story so what the
political revolution is is forcing a
debate not about trivial but about the
real issues
country faces serious different people
have different ideas but I think they
are tired of seeing politics looked at
it as if it were a baseball game or a
soap opera on the world but on some of
the major issues I think as the nation
we have got right now in this country we
have more income and wealth inequality
than any other major country on earth
and it is worse today than at any time
since the late nineteen twenties do we
find it morally or economically
acceptable on TV but are one tenth of
one percent one tenth of one percent
owns almost as much well as the bottom
90%
LA California and Vermont all over this
country we all know people who are
working incredibly long hours in fact I
don't know how many of you know this we
americans work the longest hours of any
other industrialized country people are
working $56 week the working two jobs
and three journals and yet 58 percent of
all income generated in this country is
going to the top one percent
for a while
we are talking about an economy that is
rich and let me give you an example of
what you got people all over LA they
worked in for really low wages and yet
in the last two years alone 15
wealthiest people in this country were
ready zillionaires fifteen people saw
their wealth increase by over a hundred
and fifty billion dollars fifteen people
that is more well that is owned by the
bottom hundred and thirty million
Americans so what you have right now is
a rigged economy by which the rich get
richer everybody else gets we have got
to create an economy in America and we
can which works for working families not
just billionaire
tragedy that we have got to address
which is pretty much not talked about by
politicians or the media and that is
number one real unemployment which means
people who have given up looking for
work and millions of people working part
time when they want to work full time
when you add all that together
unemployed box on the one who work
full-time people given up looking for
work
real unemployment in this country 10%
and then let me tell you something which
is never discussed and that is the
tragedy of youth unemployment in America
real unemployment and underemployment
years for kids between 17 and 22 are
high school graduates then drop out of
high school graduates and this is what
they said white kids the number is 31%
kids the number is 36% for african
American young people the number is 51%
we don't talk about this issue and
that's why last night I said I am tired
of hillary's emails let's talk about
reelection
what does when millions of young people
disproportionately Latino and
african-american I'm not in school and
what it means is a five and a half
million of them for Burlington Vermont
so Los Angeles California I hanging out
on street corners and attempted to get
into trouble and the result of that in
my view contributes to the fact that we
in America have more people in jail than
any other country on earth including
China
point two million people are in jail
today and it cost to taxpayers eighty
billion dollars a year
families are being torn apart we're
spending huge sums of taxpayer money
locked in people now it seems to be that
it makes a lot more sense for us to be
investing in education and jobs rather
than jails
lot less expensive for us to send young
people to the University of California
to lock them up
another issue all of these issues are
interconnected one of the things you
learn you know when is the
interconnectedness of all of these
issues here's another reason why write
it and that right now we have hundreds
of thousands of bright young people in
this country who have done well in
schools were qualified they can not get
a college education for one reason and
that is their families lack the funds
raised it is unfair to those young
people to say you're never gonna make it
into the middle class you're never gonna
be a doctor or a scientist or engineer
or a nurse you never gonna be able to do
that because you can't afford to go to
college that is unfair but what is even
crazier is that as a nation we need to
type all of the intellectual capability
that weekend
why I have introduced legislation which
will implement as president to make
every public college and university in
America tuition free
opponents think this is a real far I'll
radical idea it's really not right fifty
years ago fifty years ago if you were
able to graduate high school
the likelihood was that you will be able
to go out and get a pretty good job
today a college degree is the equivalent
of what I high school degree was fifty
years ago had public education in this
country for way longer than a hundred
years it is time now to include colleges
as part of free public education
and our legislation also addresses the
crisis of millions of people struggling
with very very high student debt pretty
simple why should you if you have
student debt be paying six eight 10
percent interest rates when you can
refinance your home but two or three
percent people to refinance and get the
government out of profiteering also
working class
making public colleges and universities
tuition-free why this is a revolutionary
idea is not just because it makes life
easier obviously for those people who go
to college but it does something else
even more important to a kid in the
fifth grade 6 grade in LA or in
burlington vermont that no matter what
the income of your family is and I grew
up in a family that never had a lot of
money but no matter what your income is
if you study hard if you take school
seriously if you do well you will be
able to get a college education
billion dollars on wall street
the recklessness and illegal behavior on
Wall Street drove this country into the
worst economic downturn in modern
history
Wall Street came rolling to the middle
class of this country and they said
louise bail us out I voted against the
way but now that we are seeing CEO's
Wall Street make a new compensation
packages it is their time to bail out
the middle class
you know it's a funny thing somebody
just yell out its jail time to it is it
is an interesting statement on our very
broken criminal justice system which has
more people in jail than any other
country but not as CEOs over wall street
people who sold marijuana in jail
without people have destroyed the
american economy
about major issues facing our country
and I'm just taking off some of them
afternoon there is one issue that
impacts every other issue and died as a
result of the Supreme Court's decision
in Citizens United finance system is now
corrupt and it is undermining the
foundations of American democracy and
that's just the simple truth
where every spring there all week old
town meetings people come together argue
about how much they're going to spend on
the schools and on the roads and their
budgets and all that stuff
everybody's things off they argue one
vote we are now living under a campaign
finance system where you have one vote
the Koch brothers have one vote each
plus nine hundred million dollars to buy
canada days
why I promise you that any nominee of
mind to the United States Supreme Court
will make it loud and clear that he or
she will be voting to overturn
that I am passionate believer in a very
radical concept called democracy in
human history
accuracy is a pretty new one hundred
years old and yet what we are seeing
right now is a result of citizens united
is a situation where the Koch brothers
alone will be spending more money in
this campaign cycle of the Democratic or
Republican politics when you got one
family spending more money than either
of the two major political parties
you're not talking about democracy
you're talking about a lunch date we've
got a
one of the day win when turnout so low
they win when they can suppress the vote
of people of color of low-income people
old people young people so not only do
we have to frontally take on voter
suppression and what I will do is
president used to make it very clear
that in 50 states in this country if
somebody is 18 years of age that person
is registered to vote and discuss
public funding of elections and the
reason I say that the reason I say that
is your gonna do that too
just yelled out of getting a lot of help
you guys are helping me write my
speeches I appreciate that young lady
has said if we are serious about
democracy when we give the American
people the day off and make
international
democracy I want I want anybody who is
interested in public service whether
they're conservative progressive
moderate whatever I want them to be able
to say you know what I'm gonna run for
office and I want them to be able to run
for office without having to big wealthy
people for campaign contributions
setters already a lot about another
issue of enormous consequence is our
moral responsibility France's recently
reminded of this of this moral
responsibility to leave this planet in a
way that is healthy inhabitable for our
kids and our grandchildren
there is no longer a debate the
scientific community is virtually
unanimous climate change is real it is
caused by human activity is already
causing devastating problems in our
country and all over the world that's
the bad news here's the good news is if
we are aggressive is we understand the
enormity of this problem if we lead the
world and work with russia and China and
India and other countries we can
transform our energy system globally
away from fossil fuel energy efficiency
and sustainable
when we talk about our economy what this
campaign is saying to the billionaire
class is something that is pretty simple
and that is they cannot continue to have
it all their greed is destroying this
nation and if I have anything to say
about it and i truly will as president
of the united states
in the wealthiest people in this country
will finally start paying their fair
share of taxes
everybody knows that we have in this
country today 11 million undocumented
people now what has disturbed me very
very much we have a number of republican
candidates are not only done addressing
the real issue of immigration reform
they are scooping to racist attacks
against the Latino community
2015 we have been fighting against
racism for hundreds of views on
immigration but it is not acceptable to
stoop to racist attacks against the
mexican people
when a person in this country is
undocumented when a person in this
country has no legal rights that person
is very often exploited and that person
worker cannot stand up for his or her
rights so windows workers are exploited
denied fair wages and benefits it not
only impacts them it impacts every
worker in america and leads us to a race
to the bottom
I believe that we need to provide legal
status to all people who are
undocumented as soon as possible and
what remains in my heart I had a couple
of months ago his own in Phoenix and
after a rally but we had a number of
young Latino girls teenagers came up to
me and there were tears coming out of
their cheeks down their cheeks as they
express their fear the day or their
parents could be our job is to unite
families not to divide families
is to go forward with comprehensive
immigration reform and a path toward
citizenship
the republicans refuse to cooperate I'll
job is the house for president who will
use the power of executive orders
immigration reform we have got to the
nation deal with institutional racism at
a broken criminal justice system
very very very long time african
americans have been arrested and killed
during the arrest process they have been
killed while in custody and the system
has allowed police departments to get
away with that but with the rise of this
when the american people see a video of
people like Sondra bland and many others
what the american people are saying this
is not acceptable
burlington vermont three years
will come here in the winter I work very
closely with the police department which
drew a Burlington is true of police
departments all of this country that is
most cops work really hard they're
honest it is a very difficult job also
any police officer as well as any public
official and that police officer breaks
he must be held accountable
police talk about criminal justice I
think all of us on the slim that there
is something profoundly wrong in a
nation when we see it seems God knows
every week every month another mass
killing and what about a person who
walks into an elementary school in kills
children what's another individual water
and the Whitchurch goes on to a Bible
study class and then kills nine people
because the color of their skin is
different than yours clearly what we
need to do in my view is create a
consensus a consensus which I believe
exists in this country was sensible gun
control legislation
everything those guns to make sure they
are able to get the help they need when
they need
closed in my office and I am sure that
governors and senator dole the senators
and members of congress public officials
over America medical schools and so you
know I'm worried about my brother I
don't know what he's going to do to
himself was somebody else and we
desperately looking out for help and we
can't find anything now that we can
afford and then we see what that
inaction means when we look at the front
page of the newspaper and see you know
the mass killing and another tragedy so
in my view what we should absolutely
make certain is that when people need
counseling and they need mental health
treatment they get it when they needed
not too much
where we are as a nation you read in the
media tells you that we are very divided
nation and to some degree that's true
the differences of opinion on issues
like gay marriage or abortion guns there
is a real delight in this country
quality huge issues but on the other
hand what I want to tell you is there is
a lot more commonality a lot more common
interest among people then many would be
able to believe
the ranking member on the Budget
Committee representing the democrats and
here is what the republican budget is
about the republican budget I want you
to be thinking for a moment these are
the guys who control the house and the
USA and this is what their budget is and
if you think I'm exaggerating and
kidding you know go to the internet and
check it out this is the truth this is
why I say that because it's hard to
believe what the republican budget says
is let us and the Affordable Care Act
make massive cuts in medicaid and throat
27 million people without health
insurance
now we are the only major country under
the doesn't guarantee healthcare 200
people something I want to change and
Republicans want to throw twenty seven
million people and when you ask the
ranking member I said call me if you
gonna throw twenty seven million people
without health insurance
how many thousands will become much
thicker than they should have been they
have no response at all there are and
then you go on to another issue
publicans well at a time when it is
harder and harder for working-class
families to send their kids to college
let's cut Pell Grants line 90 billion
dollars over ten year period let's make
it even harder
and by the way when families here in los
angeles city vermont are struggling to
put food on the table that's billions of
dollars in cuts in nutrition programs
and by the way after cutting health care
and nutrition and environmental programs
they have another brilliant idea and
that is why don't we provide over two
hundred and fifty billion dollars in tax
breaks to be us two tenths of one
percent
because when the american people
understand that and the media doesn't
report the store but when the american
people understand that they say these
kinds of crazy world of the living it
get away with that because in the last
election sixty-three percent of the
American people did in boats eighty
percent of young people didn't vote and
there are millions of people who know
very very little about what goes on in
washington millions of people don't even
know which political party controls the
USA house of the US senate know it's a
fact we are trying to do in this
campaign and what I mean by waging a
political revolution is to bring people
together to stand up and demand that the
United States government represents all
of us and not just a handful of
never comes from the top down it always
comes from the bottom
people struggle to build the trade union
movement so that workers could engage in
collective bargaining and earn decent
wages and benefits millions of
african-americans in their white house
lawyers and Hispanic outlines an
American allies fought to end racist
legislation in this country
but finally millions of people came
together to be president
notwithstanding the color of his skin
well women struggle in said sorry we are
not going to be second-class citizens in
america
going to be able to control our own
bodies
allies struggled to make that happen
a very long time ago somebody jumped up
and said you know I think gay marriage
should be legal in every state in
America somebody would have told them
they're crazy couldn't have to fight
what happened is the gay community in
their street allies said you know what
we are going to end homophobia in this
country
that real change can happen when we do
not allow them to divide by the color of
our skin by whether we are gay or
straight white whether we were born in
America or not in america whether we're
a woman or a man
when we stand united fighting for our
kids and our parents by the millions
making this political revolution there
is nothing nothing we cannot accomplish

old
larger say but you know super PACs are
in my mind
undermined american democracy and I
wanted to not just talk the talk walk
the walk so I said ok when I can do a
super PAC raise money all of you know
just watching them run for national
office so we saw actually reached out to
working families in the middle class of
this country possibly an amazing thing
happened that I never dreamed would have
had and that as as of today we have
received two and a half million
individual contributions more individual
contributions than any candidate in the
history of the United States
bush
drug companies change in this country
and you can do it with the support of
the middle class of this country that is
what we're trying to do it a pretty
proud of them know what's also happened
as you know when we started this
campaign I think the first national
polls how to say something like three
percent but over the last of those
numbers have gone up and they brought up
here or you know I when I gotta tell you
you're beautiful state we are seeing
just extraordinary level of enthusiasm
energy of support as of today one of the
reasons I think we have an excellent
chance to win here is that s up today we
will have had meetings like this and
lodging meetings where some 40,000 I
have come out to discuss the important
issues facing this country 40,000 in
this campaign as of today by the end of
this campaign year and I what I think
will probably
talking to people just like you want
american democracy and that's pretty
good so we have a lot of people many
thousands of all he is talking to people
making phone calls and I think that's
why we're going to win this
old-fashioned way person to person now I
think also one of the reasons we have
been successful in this campaign because
we are talking about the very very
serious issues facing the american
people and a lot of politics in America
especially because of the media does not
allow for serious discussion from a
media perspective what politics is about
its a soak up what happened if the
person person's personal life
holes it's money it's all kinds of
things but it's not really the issues
impacting the American people in a
democratic society what politics should
be about his what's going on in the
country what's wrong
how we come together to change how we
thought that's kind of what politics
should be about not ripping apart
everybody doing on the best in the world
dummies and terrible people so let's
talk about some of the important issues
facing this country and at the top of my
list are probably more and more people I
think of discussing this issue is the
issue of the grotesque level of income
and wealth inequality in this country
today we have the top one tenth of one
percent only almost as much well as the
bottle 90%
how do we feel how we feel about 20
wealthiest people in this country only
more well fifty percent of the American
people
welcome you to reflect upon think about
you have one family in America owning
more wealth than the bottom forty
percent of the emergence turns out that
the Walton family is the major recipient
of welfare country many people in this
country because they are paying their
workers wages that are so low and
benefits that are so bad that many of
their workers are on food stamps many of
their workers are on medicaid and many
other workers are in subsidized housing
so generous and kind people in the
middle class are helping to subsidize
the wealthiest family in America and
they very much appreciate
you have come up to help their employees
but you know I've got a radical idea
maybe they should pay it and he said
is that we are saying in my state and in
your people working incredibly long
hours trying to bring in enough income
and health care to sustain their not
uncommon for people to be working two or
three jobs I suspect the juniors well
not uncommon for mom to be working down
to be working
turns out that our people are working
longer hours of any people in the
industrialized world
japanese worker long as we look and yet
all of the hard work of the american
people it turns out that 58 percent of
all new income generated in this country
goes to the top one percent but that
working incredible hours 58 percent goes
to the top one percent so what we are
living in what this campaign is
addressing is the fact that we have a
rigged economy a rigged economy and
unfair economy that despite how hard
ordinary people working and going to the
top one percent so what this campaign is
about you suggesting a very radical of
you want a radical idea is a radical
idea what about an economy that works
for the middle class and not just a
handful of billionaires
and maintained by a corrupt campaign
finance system ever since the supreme
court by a five-to-four decision voted
for citizens united what that decision
said to the wealthiest people in this
country is you guys already own
much of the American economy now even
give you the opportunity to buy the
United States government now the former
chairman of the Committee on Veterans
Affairs on a river during hard we can
talk about that later but I talked to
veterans from World War two career was
it really breaks my heart to see that
people put their lives on the line to
defend american democracy and now you
have a handful of billionaires
literally able to buy elections in this
country you have one example something
over here and I will usually he was the
first caucus in the country there was a
court has held several months ago by a
gentleman named Sheldon Adelson you know
here's a multi billionaire who
contributes very heavily and what it did
several months ago in the Adelson corpus
is invited
leading Republican candidates to come
before him to tell him walk they would
do a multi-billionaire if they were
elected president and one of them will
end up getting his nomination and will
be the recipient of tens of millions of
dollars or maybe hundreds of stalls
bottom line is when you have the Koch
brothers and a few of their friends
prepared to spend nine hundred million
dollars on this campus
when Sheldon Adelson has his own caucus
is not democracy that is call oligarchy
and together we have got to change that
now when we talk about the economy it's
important to talk about jobs every month
federal government comes out of a series
of reports on unemployment sorts but one
that appears on the front pages of the
papers is official employment official
unofficial US official report tells us
that official unemployment today is five
percent believe that unemployment
workers 5% truth is there's another and
the other report which doesn't get as
much attention tells us that if you
include people who have given up looking
for work and people who are working part
time when they won't work full time real
unemployment is close to 10% about 9.9
on top of that there is the real crisis
that very few people talk about
regarding youth unemployment had a study
done to me a few months ago this is what
they say
for high school graduates not dropouts
my kids terms of unemployment and
underemployment 33 percent between the
ages of 17 and 20 latino kids 36 percent
african-american kids 51 now if anybody
in this room doesn't see the correlation
between high rates of youth unemployment
and the fact that we have more people in
jail than any other country on earth you
would be missing a very important so
here is another very radical idea second
radical idea of the day and no one is
fleeing the oil
instead of investing in jails in
incarceration for our kids what about
investing in jobs and education
and there is more than enough work to be
done in this country we have an
infrastructure roads bridges rail system
wastewater plants watered that in many
parts of this country literally grown
and that's why I have called for a one
trillion dollar investment one trillion
dollar investment what thirteen million
people back to work making our country
more efficient and safe let's rebuild
our infrastructure
the reason that sometimes a PhD in
economics to figure out that the reason
as to why people are working such long
hours has everything to do with the fact
that wages are you can do the arithmetic
as well as I can but somebody who works
for eight bucks an hour a week fifty
year is not going to earn enough money
to take care of himself or herself let
alone and that is why I believe that
anyone in America who works 40 hours a
week should not be living in poverty
that's why I believe we should raise the
minimum wage to a living wage $15 over
the next
that every man in this room there with
the women and make sure that we passed
pay equity for women workers
reason rational economic reason why
women should be making 79 cents on the
dollar compared to men that is just
old-fashioned sexism and together we are
going to change that
of politicians dropping through this and
many republicans talk about family dogs
just laws of their wealthy families of
inmates can I ask you to keep up with
keeping that light off and and they are
really into family values but does
everybody in this room know what they
mean by Sam divides what they need by
family bonds is that no one in this room
in the state in this country should be
able to control your own body I strongly
disagree
now I'm not shocked you tell you that
there is a lot of hypocrisy in politics
I know you'll be shocked when I think
there is no greater example of hypocrisy
and when it comes to a woman's right to
choose
republicans running all over this
country telling us how much they hate
the federal government how much they
hate government journal they want to cut
Social Security and Medicare investigate
everything else they want to get the
government watch your backs they want to
live your life three country make your
own decision accepts when it comes to
the very personal decision that women
sometimes have to make and then they
love the government and they want to go
to tell every woman in America
her choice should be that's wrong that's
hypocrisy I will fight that tooth
also what we talked about republican
family values but they also mean is that
gay people in this country should not
have the right to marry I strongly
disagree with us
27 grandchildren and what I talked about
international of the united states only
country on earth does not guarantee paid
family and medical
of working-class women all low-income
women there is a strong likelihood that
they will be forced to separate
themselves from those newborn baby one
week after birth
two weeks after birth to go back to work
earn enough income to do in my view that
is not what family values are about that
is the very opposite of what of family
values about a mom and dad have the
right to stay home with a newborn baby
you have a right to stay home with your
kids if your son or daughter is ill if
your mom or dad is and that is why I
should we will support and fight for
three months of paid fairly dramatically
now when we talk about our economy have
the courage to take on some extremely
powerful special interests because at
the end of the day without being too
rhetorical here real change never takes
place without struggle that's been the
history of the united states whether
it's been a civil rights movement has
been workers movements in unions whether
it's been the women's movement the
environmental movement the game that's
what happens when we talk about our
economy we have got to understand that
the greed the recklessness and the
illegal behavior of Wall Street is doing
disastrous things working men and women
in this country now everybody in this
room those that wall street's behavior
crashed the economy
2000 and so you all know that millions
of people lost their jobs they've lost
their homes they lost their life savings
and you helped bail them out they came
running the congress and they said
police bail out against Michael congress
bail them out now
today eight years later you may not be
shocked to know that the three largest
three out of the four largest financial
institutions in america are much bigger
than they were when you bailed them out
because they were too big to fail you
might not be shocked to know that the
six largest financial institutions have
assets equivalent to 60 percent of the
GDP of the United States that they issue
two-thirds of the credit cards and
one-third of the mortgages you might now
be shocked to know that since 2000 and
nine major financial institutions in
this country have paid over to
hundred billion dollars in fines for
illegal activities or reached
settlements with the government to avoid
reading over two hundred billion dollars
now mind you when you have a financial
institution too big to fail it is too
big to exist I believe we should break
there
small businesses farmers homeowners not
as we currently have on wall street and
I love unto itself only concerned about
making as much money as they can for
themselves
also you know when we've talked about
this why it is that so many of our
people of the moralizing politically why
so many people have given up on our
democracy I think it has a lot to do a
lot of factors out there but here's one
of them people see market picked up for
the possession of marijuana gets
arrested has a criminal record
see somebody else minor crime has a
police record and yet the CEOs of Wall
Street firms firms that as I mentioned
up a two hundred billion dollars in
fines for illegal activities not one has
been charged with a crime not one of
them has a police so I believe maybe I'm
old-fashioned about this we should not
have banks that are too big to fail what
bankers who are too big to jail
all people in power
earlier we have a corrupt old-fashioned
conservative but what democracy means to
me is one person one vote so if we were
here all together and we're trying to
decide something you gotta vote
everybody has an equal vote majority
rules that's kind of my vision of
democracy majority rules one-person
one-vote but clearly that has been
corrupted by the Citizens United
decision so let me make a promise to you
that if elected president
no not in need of mind to the supreme
court will get that position unless he
or she makes it very very clear and loud
that they will vote to overturn Citizens
United
because I am a passionate believer in
democracy I want this country to have
one larger one of the higher voter
turnouts in the world
not one of the low voter turnout since
will live on our young people are just
going from high school just before I
want our kids to be thinking about the
important issues I want serious debate
in this country about serious issues and
I will do everything that I can to
expand voter turnout among many other
things I will click on those republican
governors and legislators were going out
of their way to suppress the vote to
make it harder for people in this
country devote our job is to make it
easier
when we talk about this country
everybody here knows that if our economy
is going to be successful we need to
have the best educated workforce in the
world and unfortunately that is no
longer the case of once while it is not
the case
to give you one absurd exam right now as
we speak there are hundreds of thousands
of bright and qualified young people who
have the background have the building to
go to college but cannot go to college
for one reason and that reason is their
families lack the funds to me that he is
not only really unfair to those people
but it is absurd as we look at our
future economy where we need to tell all
of the intellectual capabilities of
people how many scientists and engineers
in great teaches there who cannot afford
to go to college right now so that is
why I will fight to make sure that every
public college and university in america
is tuition free
we've got to deal with another crisis
outrageously high level of student debt
in this country you have millions of
people I've been reading a lot of your
in Iowa who are carrying that some
90,000 $300,000 whatever reduce into I
met a woman to promote a couple years
ago I dream was to get a medical degree
and practice primary health care just
exactly the kind of doctors we need she
is now three hundred thousand dollars in
debt and I thought that was the highest
I was in the morning
number of months ago after a spokeswoman
comes up to me she says well bernie
actually I graduated data school and we
need to get this desperately thousand
dollars in debt just brought to the way
young man
few days ago and it wasn't nearly 90,000
and paying 53 percent of his entire
income back to the government is that
that's pretty crazy stuff so what we
wanted to also has not only made public
colleges and universities tuition-free
we want to lower interest rates on
student debt right now
right now is that you can refinance your
home
what does it cost to refinance a home
near 34 percent
refinance your home with 34 percent and
get your pain
68 10 12 percent interest rates on
student loans that does not make any
sense we're gonna give people the
opportunity to refinance their loans at
the lowest interest rates they can find
I will tell you when they were in
trouble
well now the middle class is in trouble
its wall street's turn to help working
families
now when we talk about but facing the
entire planet it seems to me there is
adults as parents and grandparents we
have got to understand we have to leave
this planet in a way that is healthy and
is habitable our children now I am all
united states and the energy committee
and I thought the scientist not only all
over our country but all over the world
the debate is over climate change is
real it is caused by human activity and
it is already doing devastating to our
country in many parts of the world as
President I will take up the mantle of
having the United States leads the world
working with China Russia India other
countries in transforming our energy
system away from fossil fuel energy
efficiency and sustainable energy and by
the way let me congratulate the people
are because you are one of the leading
states in this country in terms of
moving us toward sustainable energy wind
and biofuels congratulations
i oppose the construction of the box and
piping
energy to invest in energy efficiency
and not become more dependent upon
fossil fuels
hope that everybody understands only
major country on earth
called the United States of America
you've probably heard of that country
that does not guarantee health care to
all people know what that means is that
in the UK Canada France Germany
Scandinavia metals whatever maybe
countries have different healthcare
systems but they are all together they
all have a common goal of guaranteeing
health care to all of their people know
I helped write the Affordable Care Act
among our committee voted for it we got
some good things and I worked out by the
way with your former Senator Tom Harkin
but we still have despite the ACA we
start 29 million people without any
health insurance and even more under
what it means that probably some of you
a very large deductibles or co-payments
am i right on that
talk about the doctor bills
$107,000 how much I was like a model
where you have i mean there are 5,000 is
common person 10,000 per family whatever
it may be and what that means is that
when people get sick and they don't have
a lot of money they hesitate going to be
so what ends up happening there and I've
talked to doctors who said people walk
into their offices and a doctor said 100
company of six months ago and the
persons of wealth health insurance I
didn't have a high deductible sometimes
those people don't like it but sometimes
they end up in a hospital a great
expense to the system and then on top of
that our people paid the highest prices
in the world for prescription drugs
way back when the late nineteen nineties
I took a busload of women from northern
Vermont over the Canadian border and I
did that because many of those women
with breast cancer and they were able to
buy the medicine brand-name medicine
that they needed in Montreal for one
tenth of the price they are paying in
the United States one tenth of the price
and that's probably change but we paid
by far the highest prices in the world
not just like in Canada higher than any
other major country on earth so you will
not be shocked to know the while we pay
the highest prices for prescription
drugs while one out of five Americans
who get a prescription from a doctor
cannot afford to fill that prescription
while elderly people are cutting their
pills in half
because they can't afford to buy what
they need the three major drug companies
in this country last year made 45
billion dollars in profits forty five
billion dollars in parts so one of my
very important goals as president is to
have joined the rest of the
industrialized world guarantee health
care to all people control prescription
drug costs and the best way to do that
is doing Medicare for All single-payer
program
comprehensive health care we also say
middle-class families thousands of
dollars a year on their health care
costs because we pay almost three times
more than the british will provide
healthcare all the people 50 percent
more than the French follower than the
Canadiens so the truth is we cannot
comprehensive universal health care in a
cost effective way if we have the
courage to stand up to the private
insurance companies and the drug to be
just conclude by saying this will open
up to your questions and comments and
that is living in a country we are all
living in which ordinary country but
that over the last thirty years what we
have seen is a massive transfer of
wealth from the middle class to the top
one tenth of one percent The percentage
of wealth of the top one tenth of one
percent now owns has doubled doubled in
the last 30 years not being there I am
talking about this afternoon is
particularly radical everything that I
am talking about
exist in other countries around the
world and virtually everything that I am
talking about you supported by the vast
majority of the American people the
american people want us to raise the
minimum wage for women workers they want
us to rebuild our infrastructure they
want jobs the kids run them put them in
jail they want us to make sure that we
lead the world in addressing climate
change they want all of our people have
health care fees on radical ideas but
what has happened over the last many
years is the United States government
has become more and more separated
from the needs of the middle class and
working families and that has everything
to do with the fact that the government
is now controlled through campaign
donations to a lobbying by a small
number of corporations and very very
wealthy individuals so what this
campaign is about is not just selecting
a person of course I'm here to ask for
your support is to create a political
revolution in which millions of people
many of whom I've given up on the
political process the gym to step up and
say loudly and clearly our government
belongs to all of us and not just a
handful of wealthy campaign contributors
thank you all very much

doing what is a difficult thing to do
and that is to spend considerable
amounts of time and energy trying to
make this country a better place in
which to live and work thank you all
also say to every person in this room
that all our worst we are a hundred
times better than any of the republican
candidates are the best
say a special thanks to the many
thousands of volunteers who have worked
so hard on our campaign
we started this campaign quite fall
behind with your help we have made great
progress and I appreciate all that you
have done
also want to thank the many unions and
organizations too many to name for their
support
many others the Communication Workers of
America United Nurses United and the
American Postal Workers Union Hampshire
State Employees Association
for their support and many other
grassroots organization our campaign has
had a great deal of energy and
enthusiasm and I think the reasons are
pretty obvious we are talking about the
issues let working families and the
middle class are concerned about we are
talking about ending a corrupt campaign
finance system
american democracy is not about Wall
Street and billion as buying elections
american democracy is about one person
one vote that's what the winglet is
about
promise I made to every person in this
arena if elected president no nominee to
the supreme court will get that position
unless he or she is very clear they will
vote to overturn Citizens United
we will address rigged economy that so
many of working people are suffering on
the right now
it is not acceptable to me that at the
same time as we have the highest rate of
childhood poverty of any major country
on earth we also higher income and
wealth inequality that any other major
country on earth to the billionaire
class we are going to create an economy
that works for working families not just
the people on trial
elected president we are going to raise
the minimum wage to a living wage $15
and grace of women make in 79 cents on
the dollar compared to that
and we will pay equity for women workers
in this country
to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure
and create millions of decent paying
jobs trade disastrous trade system and
we are going to tell corporate America
start investing in this country not just
in China
we are going to say that public colleges
and universities should be questioned
three
I want every child in this country
families like mine where my mom and dad
to college I want those kids in
manchester new hampshire early to
understand to understand that if they do
their schoolwork seriously if they do
their homework and have a serious
reasons yes they will be able to get a
college education regardless of the end
of their families
and all of those people in our country
some young and some not so young people
who are now being crushed by
outrageously high levels of student debt
relief is on the way
will give we will give those millions of
people today sometimes paying twenty
twenty-five percent of their income in
student debt we are going to low
interest rates to make your debt more
bearable
senior citizens of New Hampshire many of
whom are trying to get by on eleven
twelve thirteen thousand dollars a year
in social security i understand you
understand that people can not get by on
eleven twelve thirteen thousand dollars
a year
colleagues say we should cut social
security
we should expect and social security
benefits
we are going to light lifting the cap on
taxable income
and the large multinational corporations
who continued to believe that it's okay
for them to put their billions of
dollars in profits in the Cayman Islands
and Bermuda and another tax havens we've
got news for you
going to start paying your fair share of
taxes
on wall street people whose greed and
recklessness this illegal behavior drug
this economy into the worst recession
since the nineteen thirties
bailed out by the middle class of this
country the cost of banks are too big to
fail but today in many cases are bigger
than when we bailed them out we are
going to establish a 21st century glass
six major bugs assets of almost sixty
percent of the GDP of this country
yes we are going to break up
coal industry
charges R Us highest prices in the world
for the medicine we need created a
situation in which one out of five
Americans are unable to buy the medicine
their doctors prescribe we say to them
days of raising prices off the charge
million people who are undocumented
living in the shadows earful about being
deported we say we share your pain and
we are going to pass comprehensive
immigration reform
shamefully shamefully has more people in
jail than any other country on earth we
say there will be real criminal justice
reform
education and jobs for our kids not
jails and it costs erection
we say that we are tired of seeing
people shot down by police
a police officer who breaks the law like
any other public official must be held
accountable
demilitarize local police departments
we must make police departments all
across this country look like the
diversity of the communities they serve
I have been criticized because I believe
all of our people in this great country
are entitled to health care
let me be as clear as I can I confess I
believe that health care is a right of
all people not a privilege
I believe that the Affordable Care Act
which my committee committee upon helped
to write has done some extraordinarily
good things we should be proud of that
we can go further and I believe that we
should move to Medicare for All
single-payer program
leadership is a bow is not just swimming
with the current it's not just coming up
blood
ideas when there is a majority support
for those ideas
before it was fashionable in the early
nineteen nineties congressman Burdick
said oppose nafta and other trade
agreements
corporate America to invest in this
country
create jobs in this country not just in
China
i voted against the so-called Defense of
Marriage Act
and I believe that people have a right
to love whoever they want regardless of
their child
nineteen nineties what all kinds of
people in this country republicans and
yes some Democrats said we should
deregulate Wall Street what a great idea
it would be if commercial banks and
insurance and commercial banks that
invested bags and insurance companies
could merge I didn't think it was such a
good idea
helped lead the opposition to
deregulation
in 2000 and most important debate in
recent history on foreign policy took
place
George W Bush Dick Cheney
they say
it was a good idea to invade Iraq
I listen very carefully to what they
said I didn't believe them I not only
voted against that wall I helped lead
the opposition to that war
standing up and be counted when the
times are rough when you are in a
minority situation also producing the
goods passing legislation that impacts
the people of the Hampshire for a month
and in america of the Veterans Committee
I helped pass the most comprehension of
veterans healthcare legislation passed
in the modern history of this country
not only help millions of veterans all
over this country get better access to
VA health care it was of particular
benefit to the veterans of the state of
New Hampshire
language in the bill that benefit
Hampshire veterans and I I am proud that
is part of the Affordable Care Act
twelve billion dollars in it to expand
community house and North Hampshire and
Vermont and all over this country
past one of the most significant pieces
of environmental legislation putting
billions of dollars to help communities
become less energy efficient and move to
sustainable energy
this no president not Bernie Sanders or
anybody else can bring about the changes
that the middle class and working
families of this country desperately
need and the reason for that is that the
powers that be
Wall Street corporate America the
corporate media the Koch brothers the
large coke campaign don't use so
powerful so powerful that the only way
we create the change that we need is
through a political revolution
millions and millions of people
throughout our country including many
who have given up on the political
process many who think their vote their
voice no longer matters
those people have got to re-engage
politically working people
low-income people young people and with
a loud voice a loud voice
voice heard on Tuesday in the Hampshire
and heard all over this country voice
which says that this couple hours for it
and defended by so many men and women
who prepared to put their lives on the
line this government of ours belongs to
all of us not a handful of wealthy
campaign contributors

apathy enemy is sinister we have the
solution for that please allow me to
introduce to you the next president of
the United States of America so that are
running
how'd you like the pics of history
going
not been done that is put together a
grassroots movement which takes on and
defeat the political and economic
establishment of his country
all over this country not just that
maybe just maybe we have a government
that represents the middle class and
working families rather than building a
corporate America
win just so you know what goes on
politically in this country the rich get
richer everybody else gets coral and
then people get dissolution and they say
you know I can't afford to send my kids
to college or working what are these
guys going on a boat facts are wrong
right answer is we and we change their
own woman born in this country
draw is together to fight for gender the
works for all people
a handful I don't know I don't know what
are trying a little bit strange that is
the wealthiest country in the history of
the world really high rate of childhood
poverty right a little weird well
quality than any other major country on
earth where the top 10 almost as much
well as the bottom 90%
right we've got people were true with
three drawers 50 60 hours a week
get 58 percent of all new income
1 percent right this country we have
more people in jail
proportionately african-american and
Hispanic more people to tell that any
other country order
prior to be maybe it makes more sense
for us to win
education
education rather than jails and it cost
a little bit strange to me that in the
wealthiest nation in the history of the
world which is what we are today we are
the only major country that doesn't
guarantee healthcare go over well as a
right of the trade my Republican
colleagues about family values what
they're really talking about you're
saying that we should not be able to
control their own bodies talking about
talk about their brothers and sisters
should not be able to get buried my wife
and I place
got quarter to seven grandchildren we
have a different set of how about a
United States joins the rest of the
world in case you don't have to live on
a level of $12,000 Social Security maybe
we raised and expand social security
benefits maybe we tell the truck
companies to stop ripping off the
american people
I wanna see this country the most
vibrant democracy in the world I don't
want to see your voter turnouts as we
did a year ago when 63 percent of
Americans vote eighty percent of young
people know that's not what american
democracy should be about voter
suppression we are going to make it
easier for people to not harder and the
other thing that we're gonna do as we
restore real democracy to this country
we're going to overturn this disastrous
citizens united Supreme Court
tell you that we are very few major
presidential campaigns that does not
have a super PAC I don't have a billion
or corporate America and I am immensely
proud to tell you what we have received
more individual campaign contributions
at this point in the campaign that any
campaign in american history
we are running
we are running
president election
works in other words one of the things
that we are talking about I want to the
pictures
high school degree you can take care of
your family today so what seems sensible
is that when we think of public
education we have to expand beyond great
which is why I am fighting
public colleges and universities to we
should three
and why we are also going to
substantially lower interest rates on
student but here's how we're going to
raise money and why I need your help to
make this happen
a speculation acts on Wall Street
happy about this one then when as a
result of the reckless and illegal
behavior you now here I put them to help
the middle class of this country
or look out the window
read your emails listen that's what the
american people want is creating a
political revolution your friends
president if you're interested in
transforming the United States of
America if you're interested in
participating in a political revolution
we need your help thank you

[APPLAUSE]
I AM OVERWHELMED AND I AM DEEPLY
MOVED FAR MORE THAN I CAN
EXPRESS IN WORDS BY THE FACT
THAT OUR CAMPAIGN
S'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT COMES FROM
MORE THAN ONE MILLION AMERICANS
WHO HAVE MADE OF MORE THAN $3.7
MILLION
IN INDIVIDUAL
CONTRIBUTIONS.
[APPLAUSE]

CONTRIBUTIONS THAN ANY CANDIDATE

WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND IS OUR GREAT COUNTRY
WAS BASED ON A SIMPLE PRINCIPLE
AND THAT PRINCIPLE IS FAIRNESS.
LET ME BE VERY
CLEAR -- IT IS
NOT FAIR WHEN WE HAVE MORE
INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY
TODAY THAN ALMOST ANY MAJOR
COUNTRY ON EARTH AND WHEN THE
TOP 1/10 OF 1% NOW OWNS ALMOST
AS MUCH WEALTH AS THE BOTTOM
90%.
THAT IS NOT FAIR.
IT IS NOT FAIR WHEN THE 20TH
WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THIS
COUNTRY NOW OWN MORE WEALTH THAN
THE BOTTOM HALF THAN THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
ARE YOU GUYS READY FOR A RADICAL
IDEA?
TOGETHER, WE ARE GOING TO CREATE
IN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF
US, NOT JUST THE 1%.
[APPLAUSE]
AND WHEN MILLIONS OF OUR PEOPLE

DECADES FOR THE CRIME OF TRYING
TO GET A HIGHER EDUCATION.

AMERICA, IT MEANS
ENDING THAT
HIS OF THIS COUNTRY HAVING MORE
PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN ANY OTHER
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
DISPROPORTIONATELY
AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO.

AND
A BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
--
[APPLAUSE]

PROVIDE JOBS AND
EDUCATION FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE,

AND IT IS ALREADY CAUSING
DEVASTATING PROBLEMS IN THIS
COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD.

TO WORK WITH COUNTRIES
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO
TRANSFORM OUR ENERGY SYSTEM AWAY

[APPLAUSE]
NOW I HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED
DURING THIS CAMPAIGN FOR MANY,
MANY THINGS.
EVERY SINGLE
DAY, THAT IS OK,
THAT IS ALL RIGHT.
THEY ARE THROWING EVERYTHING AT
ME EXCEPT THE KITCHEN SINK AND I
HAVE THE FEELING THAT KITCHEN
SINK IS COMING PRETTY SOON AS
WELL.
WHAT ARE CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT IS
THINKING BIG, NOT SMALL.
IT IS ABOUT HAVING THE COURAGE
TO REJECT THE STATUS QUO.
[APPLAUSE]
IT IS ABOUT SAYING THERE IS A
TIME WHEN EVERY MAJOR COUNTRY ON
EARTH DURING TIMES HEALTH CARE
-- GUARANTEES HEALTH CARE TO ALL
OF ITS PEOPLE, WE SHOULD BE
DOING THE SAME IN OUR GREAT
COUNTRY.
IN MY VIEW UNDER PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S LEADERSHIP, BEFORE THE
CARE ACT HAS BEEN -- THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS BEEN AN
IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD, BUT WE
CAN AND MUST DO BETTER.
[APPLAUSE]
29 MILLION AMERICANS SHOULD NOT
REMAIN UNINSURED AND AN EVEN
GREATER NUMBER SHOULD NOT BE
UNDERINSURED WITH LARGE
DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYMENTS.
WE SHOULD NOT BE PAYING
BY FAR
THE HIGHEST PRICES IN THE WORLD
FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS -- LISTEN
TO THIS -- AT A TIME WHEN THE
TOP THREE DRUG COMPANIES IN THIS
COUNTRY MAKE $45 BILLION IN
PROFITS LAST YEAR.

LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING --

PER CAPITAL -- OR CAPITA -- PER
CAPITA THAN ANY
OTHER NATION
THAT GUARANTEES HEALTH CARE TO
ALL OF THEIR PEOPLE AND THAT IS
WHY I BELIEVE IN MEDICARE FOR
ALL SINGLE-PAYER PROGRAMS.
[APPLAUSE]

WHILE WE MUST BE PRESENT --
RELENTLESS IN COMBATING
TERRORISTS WHO WILL DO US HARM,
WE CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT BE THE
POLICEMAN OF THE WORLD.
[APPLAUSE]
NOR SHOULD WE BEAR
THE BURDEN OF
FIGHTING TERRORISM ALONE.
IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THE UNITED

INTERNATIONAL COALITION
SUSTAINED BY NATIONS IN THE
REGION THAT HAVE THE MEANS TO
PROTECT THEMSELVES.
TOGETHER, WE MUST AND WILL
DESTROY ISIS, BUT WE MUST DO IT
IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT PUT OUR
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN THE
MILITARY INTO PERPETUAL WARFARE
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
[APPLAUSE]
MY

DIVIDES FAMILIES AND CREATE A
PATH TOWARDS CITIZENSHIP FOR
HARD-WORKING PEOPLE THAT ARE
LIVING IN THE SHADOWS.

AND EXPAND
SOCIAL SECURITY AND INCREASE THE
BENEFITS THAT SENIORS AND
DISABLED VETERANS RECEIVE SO
THAT PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN DIGNITY.
[APPLAUSE]
WE
MUST REBUILD OUR CRUMBLING
INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHEN WE DO
THAT, WE CREATE MILLIONS OF
DECENT PAYING JOBS.
WE MUST PURSUE THE FIGHT FOR
WOMEN'S RIGHTS, GAY RIGHTS, FOR
DISABILITY RIGHTS.
[APPLAUSE]
WE MUST AGAIN STRONGER
OPPOSITION OR CHECK THE RIGHT OF
A WOMAN TO CONTROL HER OWN BODY.

country
number 11
burning
not only
we need people who are working families
and take
with us this evening
we're in telling you what you already
know that as Americans we are appalled
we are disgusted by the attack against
the people of paris by the terrorist
organization and i know i speak for
everyone everyone in our country when we
send our condolences to the families who
lost loved ones and that barbaric attack
in our prayers go out with speedy
recoveries for the many hundreds more
were injured in my view now is the time
for developing serious and effective
strategy now is not the time for cheap
political talk we're trying to take
political advantage of this difficult
moment
now president Obama is trying to do to
unite the world and an organized
campaign against taxes by bringing
together all the country interest in the
international countries countries
president
we will not live in field
I am hearing my Republican colleagues
that I will just say this we will not
succumb to racism
sitcom called
everything but the shorts on their backs
we will not turn our backs on the
refugee
Americans
most importantly we will learn the
lessons of history yesterday the
chairman of the republican national
committee stated and i quote never
before have I seen an american president
President Obama project such weakness on
the global stage end of quote
many of you will remember back in two
thousand and two we had president
president bush
president bush
president but not very spot
dick cheney the whole lot of them they
would talk
and then we should invade Iraq
virtually alone in the result was 6700
brave men and women from our country
hundreds of thousands of people where an
emotional many many Iraqis dead and
wounded in the region that we are paying
the price today for the instability and
that chaos
my Republican colleagues yeah but not
we create a worldwide coalition that
will defeat Isis but no the United
States of America must not be involved
in perpetual war in the Middle East
something else they were closed
including many republicans media who
think that because of this horrific
attack only thing that we should focus
on is the feeding ice and what I say use
yes we will leave the world in defeating
I but at the same time we will rebuild
the disappearing middle class of this
country
and we can accomplish both goals
the campaign that we all know about six
months ago six months ago we began this
campaign with no money no organization
and frankly very few people in Ohio for
the rest of the country
well we have come in six and a half
months
way out over 300,000 people to rallies
like this all over america thousands of
volunteers in every state in this
country when the pundits and the experts
said you know you can't run a serious
political campaign without a super PAC
without raising money from corporations
and millionaires we are doing
proud to tell you that as of today we
have approximately 800,000 Americans
made individual contributions to our
campaign
contribution that any campaign in the
history of america at this point in a
campaign
campaign
money money we don't need
and we're very simply enter the turn
aesthetic few moments ago
very serious problems and the american
people gone that establishment politics
and establishment economics is not going
to solve those problems
understand is that a time when Wall
Street in corporate America and large
campaign donors have so much power
people instinctively understand that no
president not burning send is not
anybody else I'll be enormous problems
that we face the web people know and
what campaign it's not just selecting a
president it is creating a political
revolution
in the last election sixty-three percent
of the American people didn't vote
percent of young people didn't vote vast
majority of low-income working people
didn't vote what our job and it's not an
easy job to reach out to tens of
millions of Americans who are working in
many cases longer hours for low wages
sometimes they can afford to feed their
kids they can't afford to send their
kids to college I would draw is to reach
out to bring people together black and
white Hispanic Asian Americans gay and
straight
country people who immigrated to this
country because we lose we cannot
accomplish that's what
people in this country and when we come
together we can defeat but people with
money
all over this country given a lot of
speeches and one of the best compliments
I've received came from a guy I think
was out on the west coast he said you
know burning what I like about you is
your treating us like we are intelligent
people campaign is about fancy gimmicks
me tell you all kinds of jokes can't do
that are not much of a sense of humor
tell you all about my beautiful family
of my beautiful grandchildren but what I
will do with you which we don't do
enough simply lay on the table
the most serious issues facing our
country
that is what democracy is about
democracy is not what the media thinks
it is it's not a soap opera it's not a
baseball game because of what the polls
are done matter what what democracy is
about presumably is also talking about
the issues that we face respectfully
respectfully arguing about those issues
then coming together to resolve those
couples remember every problem that we
face was caused by human decisions every
problem that we face can be overcome by
better decisions
talking about an issue the talking about
for a very long time and I am happy that
now we are beginning to see more and
more people discuss it and that is the
issue of the grotesque level of income
and wealth inequality that exists in
america today what's going on plain and
simple
in the United States today we have more
income and wealth inequality that almost
any major country on earth and it is
worse today than at any time since 1928
today the extent of the problem today in
America the top one tenth of one percent
1% one-tenth of one percent almost as
much well as the bottom 90%
one but Walton family of Walmart more
wealth than the bottom forty percent of
the American people
in the last two year but fourteen
wealthiest people in this country have
seen their wealth increase by a hundred
and fifty six billion dollars more
wealth is owned in a targeted by the
bottom hundred and thirty million
Americans
in vermont all across this country and I
see it as like crap you got people who
are not working one job of putting out
was working two jobs maybe they're
working three jobs husbands are working
why it wasn't working kids of working
all trying to cobble together the income
they need does the slaying the body
health care put gas in the car to pay
the electric bills and yet today in
America 58% of new income 58% is going
to the top one percent
campaign is simply site is creating an
economy that works for all of us and not
just million head billion
and there's campaign is sending a simple
and straightforward message that the
billionaire place and that is in america
when people the power
billion class will not happen
children go hungry
not continue sending our jobs to China
when millions of people are in desperate
need of good paying work here in America
they will not give huge compensation
packages to the CEOs of large
corporations when they cut the wages and
pensions and health care
and let me just recognize I think some
of the teamster friends
all over this country a promise that was
made to tens of thousands of workers in
guaranteeing them their pensions if you
have anything to say about it and Marcy
Kaptur of Ohio when I do to make sure
that will not be caught
what's going on in america we have to
take a deep breath just take a hard look
at what we see around us
I see I see that today our economy is in
fact better than it was when george bush
left office
something our republican friends we
shouldn't be too hard on them because
they suffer from a very serious illness
called amnesia they could get public in
friends are listening
try to overcome let me remind you of
seven years ago before Obama and Biden
took office
my Republican friends say well you know
we're only going to 250,000 jobs a month
not enough they're right but it's a hell
of a lot better to grow 250,000 jobs
than 200,000 jobs
my Republican colleagues against
suffering from this very seriously they
worry about the deficit not as a serious
problem but they forgot when bush left
office we had a record-breaking one
point four trillion dollar deficit we've
cut that but true
and by the way when bush left office the
American and international financial
system was on the verge of collapse
just in passing we might want to mention
that
the truth is we have made significant
progress in the last seven years against
unprecedented republican obstructionism
on the democratic president and
republican presidents the great middle
class of our country once the envy of
the entire world has in fact been
disappearing despite exploding
technology and increased worker
productivity median family income today
is almost $4,000 less than it was in
1999 and in and the dollars we have
millions of people working men and women
who are earning less money than was the
case thirty or forty years ago that's
the reality
so the question to ask ourselves is how
does it happen that when workers are
producing more because of exploding
technology they are earning less and
working longer hours we are going and
let me tell you something else we talk
about the economy
every month us' government issues a
report on unemployment and what you see
on the front page of the paper thought
official unemployment which actually is
about 5% but what you don't see is that
if you add to that 5% people who have
given up looking for work or people who
are working part time when they want to
work full time real unemployment is
close to 10 percent
that we virtually never discuss and that
is the tragedy of youth unemployment in
this country
I asked him economists' couple of months
ago to do a study for me this is what
they found him listen to this because
this is really very significant what
they fell is that for high school
graduates graduates not dropouts between
the ages of 17 and 24 white kids real
unemployment and underemployment is 33
percent for Hispanic kids 36% for
african-american kids 51% like what kids
want to graduate high school they want
to stand up on their own two feet about
to get out of the house they want to
start earning some money they want to
become independent they want to
slaughter Korea wanna become adults but
when half of the african-american kids
in this country and its cities like
Cleveland that number may even be on
white kids in this country are unable to
stand on their own two feet and get out
and get a decent job bad things begin to
happen
anybody here there is a direct
correlation between outrageously high
youth unemployment and the fact that we
as a nation have more people in jail
than any other country on earth you
would be mistaking
tell you i think is the most common
sense but it's out there and that is
that instead of investing in jails and
cost erection maybe we should invest in
jobs and education
billion dollars a year
blocking our people why don't we take a
fraction of but and use it to create
jobs for young people hanging out on
street corners
heck of a lot less money to send
somebody to the University of Ohio that
put him in jail
right there at the end of my first term
as president the United States of
America will not have more people in
jail than any other country we're going
to have the best in the world
economy brothers and sisters it is not
only the protest level of income and
wealth inequality that's not only
unemployment it is the fact that in your
state and in my state and all over this
country people working longer hours for
low wages and they're working at wages
that do not sustain themselves or their
families and there are people all
working 40 hours a week and then they
have to go to the food shelf in order to
get food to feed their families that
wage earners in america are too damn low
up seven and a quarter an hour here's a
spot wage
in this country
28 living wage 15 bucks and hour over
the next
and when we talk about fair wages I hope
every man he will stand with the women
pay equity for women working
there is no economic reason why women
are making 79 cents on the dollar
compared to men it is sex is not
acceptable
a word about family values you heard
many republicans expressing deep deep
concern
families especially very wealthy
families might contribute to their
campaigns
passionate about unquote family bounds
and everyone here knows what they mean
by family what they mean is that no
woman in America should have the right
to control her own body
and what they mean by family values is
that our gay brothers and sisters should
not have the right to get married I
disagree
senator mixture the early are very
blessed to have great kids and seven
beautiful grandchildren and my wife Jane
and I have been married for 27 years we
believe in family and we believe in
family values but our values just a
little bit different than republican
family guys talk about family values
what I am talking about is ending the
international embarrassment of the
United States of America being the only
major country on earth does not
guarantee hey Family and Medical Leave
it is not a family value to tell a woman
who has just given birth that she has to
be separated a week or two after giving
birth from her baby
has to go back to work and order to earn
the necessary income she needs to
sustain that family could cause there is
no additional income coming under here's
the good news
the good news is that in the congress in
the senate and in the house there is a
very small piece of legislation the
Family and Medical Leave Act we got
nineteen sponsors in the senate
introduced by Senator Gillibrand in the
house we have over a hundred introduced
by congresswoman rosa DeLauro and what
this legislation says of what I strongly
believe is that in America we will
guarantee every family three months of
pay
to those families
third of the income they were and we do
that all the cost of about $1 3800 week
not a bit price to pay a buck 38 a week
my hope is that every candidate for
president especially those who talk
about family values will come on board
and support legislation
when we talk about the economy and when
pollsters go out in the cold
what is on your mind what is on the
minds of the american people always
always always the answer is jobs and the
economy because people understand how
volatile the economy as they understand
that if you up 55 years of age you can
go to work tomorrow and your boss could
say well for thirty years of work joke
but we were facing you with somebody
half your age and half and they
understand that if you're a college
graduate
it is hard to get work commensurate with
your education
high school kid drop out it is hard to
find any work in any way that is why in
my view given unemployment
underemployment the outrageous level
youth unemployment
the federal government must undertake a
massive federal jobs program to put our
people back to work
we should firing teachers and child care
workers
our infrastructure roads bridges water
systems wastewater plants our rail
system our airports all levels and else
in many safe are collapsing we can
create millions of decent paying jobs
rebuilding our infrastructure and output
by the way and let me say this very
clearly to the folks in Ohio when we
talk about jobs it's not only creating
good-paying jobs it is preventing the
loss of good-paying jobs because of
disastrous trade policies
congressman and a senator who proudly
tells you he voted against nafta against
permanent normal trade relations
helped lead the effort to defeat this
disastrous trans-pacific partnership
corporate america likes it or not
they're investing in the United States
of America creating jobs here not just
in China and Vietnam
when we use words like greed and fraud
and dishonesty and allergens these are
just a few of the adjectives we can use
to describe Wall Street
everybody here knows is that the greed
and recklessness and the illegal
behavior on Wall Street pro this country
into the worst economic downturn since
the Great Depression and what happened
is that millions of people jobs found
new jobs many of them lost their homes
and many people lost their life savings
making retirement
much more typical we need banking system
in this country that is part of the
probe dr economy that provides
affordable loans to small and
medium-sized businesses so they can
create jobs
need a banking system in which the 66
largest financial institutions in this
country
assets equivalent to 58 percent of the
GDP of America 6 financial institutions
which issue two-thirds of the credit
cards
one-third of the mortgages when you have
financial institutions and water that
have so much economic power so much
political power during the effort to
deregulate Wall Street which helped lead
the opposition to they spent Wall Street
spent five billion dollars over a
ten-year period on lobbying and campaign
contributions when you have an entity
like water which has so much economic
and political power which is making so
many campaign contributions to super
PACs Democrats and Republicans the
answer to what we have to do is obvious
and that is reestablished glass steagle
break up
financial institutions of Bible Way
three out of the four largest financial
institutions in this country today are
bigger now than they were when we bailed
him out because they were too big to
fail financial institution is too big to
fail it is too big to exist
legislation to take marijuana out of the
controlled substance
number of reasons most importantly over
the last many many years hundreds and
hundreds of thousands of people have
been arrested for possessing marijuana
and they get police records
police record it makes life difficult it
makes it much harder to go out and get a
jet go get a job it makes it harder to
find housing to get the same credit and
in some cases people ended up in jail so
I find it very interesting in terms of a
broken criminal justice system might
find interesting that hundreds of
thousands of people have criminal
records for possessing marijuana but not
one CEO on wall street criminal record
bring major major reforms a broken
criminal justice system we should not be
a country in which we have banks too big
to fail and bankers too big to jail
I am asked you know bernie which
particular issue is the most important I
can never answer them because all of
these issues are so terribly important
but there is one issue which impacts all
other issues and that is five years ago
the Supreme Court in one of the worst
decisions ever made in the history of
the Supreme Court 524 on the Citizens
United case
the wealthiest people in this country
they said guys you already own
much of the economy now we're going to
allow you to purchase United States
government and that is what they are
trying to do right now
very proud to tell you i'ma former
chairman of the USS Senate Committee on
Veterans Affairs we worked very hard to
protect the interests of our veterans
talk to some wonderful people were
fought in World what career in vietnam
only through Iraq and Afghanistan and
these people have put their lives on the
line and of course many of our soldiers
never came home to defend american
democracy american democracy is not
about billionaire's buying elections
a situation where the second wealthiest
families in this country the Koch
brothers in a few of their friends
heard the Koch brothers and spend some
900 million dollars in an election cycle
more money the Democratic or Republican
Party will spend that is not democracy
that is oligarchy and we thought
that I make you know nominee of mine to
the supreme court will get that position
unless he or she is loud and clear in
saying they will vote to overturn
Citizens United
democracy together we are going to stand
up and tell republican governors and
legislators they will not get away with
suppressing the vote
people old people young people that they
cannot vote because
on line for hours in order to exercise
their democratic right to vote we are
going through a constitutional amendment
or some other way we are going to reach
the day went simply and
straightforwardly anybody 18 years of
age or older have the right to vote and
the discussion
don't have the guts to participate in
free and fair elections these cowards
should get another job
in America in which we have not one of
the lowest voter turnout in the
industrialized world but one
to make it easy for people to
participate in the political process not
hard
in a very competitive global economy and
in that context it makes 0 sense to me
that we are hundreds of thousands of
bright and qualified young people who
want to go to college who shot the in
college but can't go to college for one
reason and that is their families lack
the
should be about and that is why I have
introduced legislation and will make
happen its president a process in which
every public college and university in
america is 23
appreciate what that is about telling
every kid in Cleveland and in burlington
vermont that no matter what your income
if you study hard if you do your
schoolwork seriously you will be able to
get a college education
and we are also going to deal with the
outrage of millions of people having
high interest rates on their student
debt
nonsense to be there people are paying
68 10 12 14 percent interest rates on
student debt when you can refinance a
home for three or four percent
people with student that to get the
lowest possible interest rates they can
find
providing the public colleges
universities and lowering student
interest rates an expensive proposition
we are going to pay for that by imposing
a tax on wall street
as a result of their greed and
recklessness crashed they came running
to the congress and begging us to bail
now to help the middle class
when we talk about our responsibilities
as adults as citizens as parents one of
those responsibilities is to make sure
that really future generations a planet
that is healthy and a half
the debate over climate change is real
causing devastating problems and we have
a moral responsibility to work with
countries around the world to transform
our energy system away from fossil fuel
to energy efficiency
and if we do not do that but the
scientists tell us the end of this
century this planet will be up to five
degrees warmer than it is today
more droughts or floods more extreme
weather disturbances we have a moral
responsibility to make sure that does
not happen
and when we talk about where we should
also recognize that today the united
states of america is the only major
country on earth does not guarantee
health care to all people
on the committee that wrote the
Affordable Care Act that we have made
some good progress in this country
through the Affordable Care Act we can
and we must do
29 million people still have health
insurance and many more are underinsured
with large deductibles and co-payments
major country on earth can guarantee
health care to all of their people in a
much more cost effective way than we do
how can the united states of america
can't do that
when we gone through an issue which is
also very much on our minds and ideas as
a nation the understanding that we have
got to put an end to institutional
racism
not just talking about very sick
individuals some months ago for example
walked into a church Bible study class
in Charleston South Carolina just killed
nine people because of the color of
their skin and I'm not talking about and
it was only able to be thinking about
this we have hundreds of organizations
in this country whose sole function is
to push forward
Americans hatred against immigrants
hatred against catholics hatred against
Jews that's what they do but I'm not
just talking about that what I am
talking about is the fact that in this
country we have seen and we've seen much
too often too many african-americans on
all killed by the police when and cost
two other sons are bland and Michael
Brown or a keyboard or called horrible
pretty great arrives
I do not want to read about or see and
you do not want to read about was see
children being shot because they have a
choice gun
continue to see over 100 bullets being
shot into a call
the largest city in the state of Vermont
Burlington Vermont I had the privilege
of working with our police lawmen and
let me tell you what I think most of you
know most police officers are honest and
hardworking and do it very difficult job
many of them are under pain they have
crazy schedules but also very clear and
that is when any police officer any
public official breaks the law that must
be held accountable
tonight no president will work harder
than I and ending institutional racism
in this country and in report for
forming a very very broke in criminal
justice system
a few of the things that have to be done
first thought we have got to
demilitarize our police departments
television local police look like
they're invading the community they are
supposed to be serviced good or good
police department and there are many of
them are part of the community are
trusted by the community on not seen
there's a foreign invading force
that reflect the diversity of the
communities they serve
allowable use Outlaws Late Late is the
last resort not the first one
introduced legislation to do this
of private corporations making profits
by building and running prisons and
detention
drug and medical and mental health
intervention
addiction should be seen as an illness
and treated as such
today from prison to civil society
and when we talk about issues facing our
country I want everybody here not to
forget that there are 11 million people
in this country today who are
undocumented who are living in fear and
living in the shuttle's
people mosque how the rights of legal
status we must pass comprehensive
immigration
and we must follow a path toward
citizenship
hope what I hope that we can do as a
nation and as a people is to think big
not small we are many people don't know
what we today on the wealthiest nation
in the history of the world most people
don't know that because almost all of
the well is resting in the hands of a
few I would say that ever wealthiest
nation in the history of the world with
an enormously productive work with some
great universities and scientists and
teaches there is nothing if we put our
mind that we cannot accomplish don't get
yourself involved in a world view which
says well do we cut education by 2%
raise it by one percent that is not the
dynamic that we should be looking out is
that in the wealthiest country on earth
why is the situation existing in which
every parent to work knows that his or
her kids are in the best quality pre-k
and child care in the world
we can do it tell me why we cannot do
what many other countries do and make
sure that everybody in the country has
the ability of the file is able to get
all of the education regardless of why
can't we do
in this country we have the highest rate
of childhood poverty of almost any major
country on earth though told me we have
to have told me that the united states
that the United States has to be the
only major country not to guarantee
health care to all people provide paid
Family and Medical Leave
United States has to continue having
more income and wealth inequality than
any other major country on earth and how
corporations that make billions but we
end up paying a given year almost
nothing in taxes don't tell me that that
is what country we have to be
that we can have the best health care
system in the world for all about people
to tell me that we can lead the world in
transforming our energy system and
combating climate change
workers in america will not be losing
the patrons they were provided
and people with disabilities
well in fact see an increase in their
social security benefits not a cut
there together we will and racism sexism
but contrary we can create when we come
to go when we stand up and fight back
and when we create a dog that works for
all and not just a handful of billion
revolution

cool
like them hard i would tell everybody to
sit down
whether or not seems like
I'll let me begin to tell you to do so
well my wife we just celebrated not want
the southern
wedding anniversary the
you know I which is why do you always
look with a warning we couldn't believe
it
song media most likely sold
the
and what the mall soul let me also
apologized
we didn't have a look who we is about 10
days ago we said we're going to build
more than I walk
let's go to Minnesota who pupil show off
we SBS you're you're going to use the
whole thing flying 200 people
not what the hell were we came here this
is not because we ran out of food
or apologize apologies that's why would
a cold
everybody would like board
the home just tell you about the client
we
that we've had which is pretty crazy on
boosted also rolling
formally kicking off a campaign to my
hometown
a brawling mile we r 5,000 people coming

that would Hampshire standing-room-only
provided last couple days with no I
would just lose
ordinary response and book what we're
doing here
today the
so I think it is said
we all to age strong saw it
in this had a campaign which is calling
for
a political revolution the
well water and this is
what I mean from the bottom of my heart
also with everything that I believe
intellectually like her jams burning
burning burning I appreciate that
but this is not about bird it really is
about you
and want to talk about a political
revolution what everybody has got on the
stand
is that the do you know class and their
representatives in Washington
muscle that this president in the world
cannot 23 them along we need a mess
movement of millions of people the
the mall good anymore stands all

allows
in our government belong to all people
and not just ahead the
this country to eat
things is more serious problems than any
time since the Great Depression
and you ROWID if you added
the planetary prices a climate change
the problems today maybe even
Moule serious and here is why
promise to you put this game
not only will I quite to protect the
working families in this country
what we all going bill
a permanent move in this country in
which we are going to standoff
and fight and we're going to do that
not necessarily with millions of
30-second TV yet
we got the goal directly to the people
in meetings like that
would we're gonna be knocking on doors
all who's all were american and we're
going to be doing our very best
didn't know working families in this

deep nope
let me just very briefly very briefly
give you 10
you also know the usual that we are

face
is the world level of commonweal
inequality in a bar
murder good we have
more in calm in wealth inequality than
any other major industrialized country
on earth
and it is worse today that any time
since nineteen the want me not mine
years well and income inequality
is the great moral if you are welcome
I'm
it is a great economic sure about mine
it is a great political if you all-out
but we all gotta deal
money be very clear about this let me

and we look to washington and Lisa pay
those people
they're not dealing with the realities
my like and they listen to the EU
television global political gossip all
kinds the ground and not talking about
the realities facing
ordinary Americans media looking at
politics as a war
baseball game was so well rather than
addressing
issues we transform America what we need
to do in my view
you know the with your help and we have
a website which is
going to get better and political Bernie
Sanders like are we want your like to
use we want your feedback as we work
well together but
a sexually what we need to do use create
engine
clear jed me examines the working
families
all this country as to what the
government should be doing
to transform our country. and improve
lives well
what I wanted to know in a few minutes
lil
pretty quickly your I want to watch
online would like
the innocent more be progressive agenda
and the person who
I'll is when you to all the people you
want to be when we do polls
what people would say when you ask them
what is the most important thing on
their minds
it's evil little world more jobs
jobs and the reason they say that is the
No
that unemployment is much too long they
worry about the kids being able to get a
decent job
they were relieved to be there gonna be
label
and not be able to get a job that pays
them have the wages that currently
burning
so in my view weenie
medium rule jobs program
the grease millions a decent paying jobs
and at a time when our infrastructure is
crumbling
10 rules out which is all water systems
always
plans no airport I will I'll let the
user know them million in almost a mile
a word we are not doing as
happened in we believe it is impersonal
and when we do and we make this country
moral
should walk do and sleep well and we can
agree with the $1 trillion dollar
investment
with higher proposed what to order
million
these Jones
you too slowly
marginal greeley jewels which we have to
do
it is a question of saving and preserve
jobs
you are looking at the United States on
who was born again trade agreements like
the
500 after you have to remember the
normal trade relations with China
and I'm gonna help leaders opposition
against the trans-pacific partnership
proved that since 2001
in vermont Minnesota are all over this
country we have more
almost six the thousand factories
and millions of babies and jobs where
you'll
who rolls trade agreement record should
America and the drug companies
and will reminded in with the hollywood
is a great situation with a good shot
down with America
and moved to countries an hour job is
the hell
that we want trade agreements all for
american workers
workers good we would
really jobs in america nachos
good the
and when we more well the economy when
we talk about the economy

been built here's a look at some of the
older women doing the same work
his bed make 78 cents on the dollar
that's got changed
and we'll talk respect
working with people of this country know
that every worker in america
as exactly and guarantee
but should
now we deal with an incall in wealth
inequality what we have to understand
is not just well-used people in this
country
in the largest corporations are doing
phenomenally well
what we also have do understand is that
we have
a acts is a global which is written by
these very same people

help me while going senator Bernie
Sanders
on this beautiful day
Shwetha wonderful introduction my
message to you all today pretty simple
one and that is our country faces
enormous problems and these problems are
not going to be solved if people turn
away from political struggle of people
throw up their hands and thus parents i
dont wanna get involved it's all crap
you are getting a great education here
in Georgetown and I hope very much you
will learn use what you have learned
here to fight to create a better world
and to follow in the traditions of so
many people for so many years have
struggled to create a more democratic
and just society let me take you now
back to the 1937 and in his inaugural
address in the midst of the Great
Depression President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt looked out at the nation
that's the discoverable depression and
this is what he saw and talked about in
his inaugural
tens of millions of people denied the
basic necessities of life he saw
millions of families trying to live on
incomes so meager that the ball a family
disaster home over them every single day
he saw millions of his fellow Americans
denied education recreation and the
opportunity to better their lot in the
lot of their children he saw millions
lack
the means to buy the products they
needed and Biovail poverty by their lack
of disposable income denying employment
too many other millions because when you
don't have money to spend
you're not creating jobs for other
people he saw one third of a nation in
house Bill Clyde and ill and he acted
against the ferocious opposition of the
ruling class of his day people he called
the economic royalists roosevelt
implemented a series of programs that
put millions of Americans back to work
took them out of dire poverty and
restored their faith in government he
redefined the relationship of the
federal government to the people of our
nation he combat it
citizenM fear and despair he
reinvigorated democracy he transformed
our country and that is exactly what we
have to do today and by the way almost
everything he proposed almost every
program every idea he introduced was
called socialist
I thought I would mention that just in
passing
social security which all of you know
transformed life was senior citizens in
this country was defined by his
opponents as socialist the concept of
the minimum wage that workers had to be
paid at least certain amount of money
for their labor was seen as a radical
intrusion into the marketplace and was
described as socialist unemployment
insurance when you lose your job you
have something to fall back upon
abolishing child labor and the fact that
children of eight ten twelve years of
age were working in factories are
working in the fields the 40 hour work
week collective bargaining the rights of
workers to engage in negotiations with
the union
banking regulations deposit insurance
and job programs that put millions of
people to work for all described in one
way or another as socialist yet as you
all know all of these programs and many
more have become the fabric of our
nation and in fact the foundation of our
middle class thirty years later after
Roosevelt's speech at the nineteen
sixties President Lyndon Johnson 44
medicare and medicaid
to provide health care to millions of
senior citizens and families with
children
persons with disabilities and some of
the most vulnerable people in this
country today medicaid does not seem to
be such a terribly radical idea to save
them when somebody gets old they should
have medical insurance but when it was
proposed once again we're hired
right-wing forces describe these
programs as socialistic and a threat to
the American Way of life that was then
now is now today in the year 2000 in 15
despite the Wall Street Crash of 2008
which drove this country into the worst
economic downturn since the Great
Depression the American people are
clearly better off economically than
they were in 1937 but here is a very
hard truth that we must acknowledge we
must address we must not sweep under the
rock and that is despite a huge increase
in technology and I i was mayor of the
City of Burlington Vermont anybody hear
from Vermont
in the nineteen eighties a radical
development took place we got computers
in city hall nineteen eighties despite a
huge increase in technology and worker
productivity meeting that almost every
worker in america with that technology
is producing a lot more than workers
that came before despite major growth
GDP and a huge increase in the global
economy
hands of millions of American families
continued today to lack the basic
necessities of life while millions more
struggle every day to provide a minimum
standard of living for their families
and I hope none of you will turn your
back on that reality and the truth is
and again this is a truth we must put on
the table yes we are better off today
economically than we were seven years
ago when bush left office but the other
truth is that for the last forty years
or two years on the republican
leadership and democratic leadership the
great middle class of our country has
been in decline and faith in our
political system is now extremely low
new technology increase worker
productivity productivity people work
longer hours for low wages faith in our
political system now extremely low the
very rich get richer almost everyone
else gets super PACs funded by
billionaire has by elections Koch
brothers alone in a few of their friends
will spend more money in this election
cycle than either the Democratic or
Republican Party's
ordinary people working people young
people don't vote we have any economic
and political crisis in this country and
the same old same old politics and
economics will not effectively address
those crises if we are serious about
transforming our country and I hope all
of you are serious about transforming
our country if we are serious about
rebuilding the American middle class if
we are serious about reinvigorating
american democracy we need to develop a
political movement which once again is
prepared to take on and defeat a ruling
class whose greed is destroying our
nation
terms like ruling class probably
Georgetown
and in my view the billionaire class
must be told loudly and clearly that
they cannot have it all our government
belongs to all of us not just a handful
of billionaires
politics and culture which has reminded
us can not just be based on the worship
of money we must not accept a nation in
which billionaire's compete as to the
size of their super yachts while
children in america go hungry and
veterans men and women will put their
lives on the line to defend us sleep out
on the streets today in America we all
the wealthiest nation in the history of
the world but few Americans know that
because so much of the new income and
wealth is going to the people on top in
fact over the last thirty years there
has been a massive redistribution of
wealth problem is it has gone in the
wrong direction
trillion dollars from the hands of
working families and the middle class to
the top one tenth of one percent a
handful of people top one-tenth of one
percent who have seen a doubling of the
percentage of the wealth that they own
during that period doubling of the
percentage wealth they are unbelievably
and grotesquely the top one tenth of one
percent today nearly as much well as the
bottom 90% one-tenth of one percent owns
nearly as much well as the bottom 90%
that is not the kind of america that we
should accept
I can tell you that in my state of
Vermont and all over this country it is
absolutely not uncommon to see people
working two jobs or three jobs the
cobble together the income of the health
care they and their families need in
fact americans work longer hours than do
the people of any other industrialized
country but despite the fact that all
people are working so hard I go around
the country and I see a lot of working
people and you can see the stress and
exhaustion on their faces their work
increasing our husbands hardly see wives
people don't have the quality time for
their kids because the working so hard
just to bring up bringing the income to
survive event despite all of that
despite our people working so hard D
eight percent of all new income
generated today is going to the top one
percent today in america is the middle
class continues to disappear median
family income is 40 $100 less than it
was in 1999 the median male worker made
over $700 less than he did forty two
years ago in inflation-adjusted dollars
you know why people are angry they are
angry because they are working terribly
hard and getting real inflation-adjusted
dollars they are earning less and they
look at all over a nice I'm what's
happening why you stopped but it's not
just last year the media fame female
worker earned more than $1,000 less than
she did in 2000 and seven and 58 percent
of all new income goes to the top one
percent today in America the wealthiest
country in the history of the world
that's what we ought today more than a
half of older workers
have 0 retirement savings think about
that you are 50 55 years of age and
youth we can all right how much to
retire but because my wages have gone
down I have zero in the bank for
retirement and at the same time all over
america you got millions of seniors and
people with disabilities trying to
survive on twelve or thirteen thousand
dollars a year
social security from Ramon California
older workers are scared to death and
they are saying how am I gonna retire
with dignity and i wanna love you can
get your calculators out not now when
you leave you do some arithmetic and try
to put yourself in the place of a senior
citizen in my state of Vermont gets cold
in the winter
trying to supply pump $13,000 a year and
you tell me how you are going to pay for
the food that you need your home and by
the medicine that you need and you know
what you can't do it today in America
nearly 47 million people are living in
poverty and over 20% of our children
including 36 percent of african-american
kids are living in poverty the highest
rate of childhood poverty of almost any
nation on earth and what I want you to
think about is why is it in the
wealthiest country in the history of the
world where we're seeing the
proliferation of millionaires and
billionaires we have the highest rate of
childhood poverty of almost any major
country on Earth today in America 29
million americans have no health
insurance and even more are underinsured
with outrageously high co-payments and
deductibles in other words people do
have insurance but I talk to people
every day I got a $5,000 deductible
8,000 although they can't go to the
doctor when they need and then on top of
that for a wide variety of reasons our
people pay the highest prices in the
world for prescription drugs and doctors
tell me all of the time we prescribe
something I medicine for all patients
they can't afford to fill that medicine
that prescription one out of five
Americans cannot afford to fill the
prescriptions their doctors right what
insanity is that today in America youth
unemployment and underemployment is over
35% for african-american kids it is over
50% meanwhile we have more people in
jail than any other country China
communist authoritarian country four
times our size we have more people in
jail than China and countless lives are
being destroyed as we spend eighty
billion dollars a year
locking up our fellow Americans the
bottom line is that today in America we
not only have massive wealth and income
inequality but a power structure built
around that inequality which protects
those who have the money today a handful
of super-wealthy campaign contributors
have enormous influence over the
political process while their lobbyists
determine much of what goes on in
congress and any member of the United
States House or Senate
who is prepared to tell you the truth
will tell you exactly that now in 1944
in his State of the Union speech
President Roosevelt outlined what he
called a second bill of rights are all
familiar with our bill arrives and what
roosevelt outline was what he called a
second bill of rights
this is in my view one of the more
importance pitchers ever made by a
president but unfortunately it has not
gotten the attention that it deserves so
I'm gonna give it some attention today
in his remarkable speech this is what
roosevelt stated and i quote we have
come to a clear realization of the fact
that true individual freedom cannot
exist without economic security and
independence just sensitive men and we
would add women are not free men and
women and of course in other words real
freedom must include economic security
that was roosevelt's vision seventy
years ago it is my vision today it is a
vision that we have not yet achieved and
it is time that we did
in that speech roosevelt described
economic rights are I G H T S writes
that he believed every american was
entitled to the right to a decent job at
the same page the right to adequate food
clothing and time off from work
the right for every business large and
small to function in an atmosphere free
from unfair competition and domination
by monopolies the right of all Americans
to have a decent home and decent health
care what roosevelt was stating in 1944
what martin luther king junior stated in
similar terms twenty years later and
what I believe today is that true
freedom does not occur without economic
security people are not free
they are not truly free when they are
unable to feed their family they are not
truly free when they are unable to
retire with dignity they are not truly
free when they are unemployed
underemployed or when they are exhausted
by working 60 70 hours a week people are
not truly free when they don't know how
they're going to get medical help when
they or a family member are sick so let
me take this opportunity to to find for
you simply and straightforwardly what
democratic socialism means to me it
means building on what franklin delano
roosevelt said when he fought for
guaranteed economic rights for all
americans and it builds on what martin
luther king junior said in 1968 when he
stated and i quote this country has
socialism for the rich and rugged
individualism for the pool and of course
few democratic socialism builds on the
success of many other countries around
the world who have done a far better job
than we have in protecting the deeds of
their working families they are elderly
citizens their children they are sick
and their pool democratic socialism
means that we must reform political
system which is corrupt that we must
create an economy that works law not
just the very wealthy democratic
socialism to my mind speaks to a system
which for example during the nineteen
eighties and I want you to hear this
allowed Wall Street to spend by billion
dollars over a ten-year period in
lobbying and campaign contributions in
order to get deregulated they wanted the
government of their backs they wanted to
do whatever they wanted to do
spent five billion dollars over a
ten-year period on lobbying and campaign
contributions then ten years later after
their greed and recklessness and illegal
behavior led to their collapse
what our system enables them to do is to
get bailed out by the United States
government which through Congress and
the Fed provided trillions of dollars in
aid to wall street in other words
wall street use their wealth and power
to get Congress to do their bidding for
deregulation and then when Wall Street
collapse they use their wealth and power
to get bailed out quite a system and
then to add insult to injury we were
told that not only were the banks too
big to fail we were told that the
bankers were too big to jail
this is the system young people who get
caught possessing marijuana they get
police records and many many hundreds of
thousands of them have received police
records which have impacted they live in
very serious ways on the other hand Wall
Street CEOs who helped destroy the
economy they don't get police records
they get raises in their salaries and
this is what dr. Martin Luther King jr.
meant when he talked about socialism for
the rich and rugged individualism for
everyone else in my view it is time we
had democratic socialism for working
families doctors for Wall Street
billionaires and large corporations it
means that we should not be providing
well fail for corporations it means that
we should not be providing huge tax
breaks for the wealthiest people in this
country or trade policies which boost
corporate profits while they result in
workers losing their jobs it means that
we create a government works works for
all of the american people not just
powerful special interests it means that
economic rights must be an essential
part of what America stands for among
many other things it means that health
care should be a right of all people not
a privilege
I know there are some people out there
wasn't this is just a incredibly radical
I imagine in the United States of
America all of us having health care is
a right but I hope all of you know this
is not a radical idea it is a
conservative idea it is an idea and a
practice that exists in every major
country on earth you know not just in
Scandinavia Denmark Sweden Norway it
exists in Canada I live fifty miles away
from Canada France Germany Taiwan all
over the world countries have made the
determination that all of their people
are entitled to health care and I
believe the time is long overdue for the
United States to join the rest of the
world
for all single-payer program which i
support would not only guarantee health
care for people not only save
middle-class families and our entire
nation significant sums of money because
all of you should know that our health
care system is by far the most expensive
per capita of any system on earth but a
Medicare for All single-payer program
would radically improve the lives of all
Americans and bring about significant
improvements in our economy
think about it people who get sick will
not have to worry about paying a
deductible or making a co-payment
radical idea when they are sick they can
actually go to the doctor and not end up
in the emergency room at a much greater
expense to the system
think about it business owners will not
have to spend enormous amounts of time
worrying about how they're going to
provide health care for their employees
think about it and we don't talk about
this very much you got millions of
workers in this country who are staying
on Jobs in jobs which they do not want
to stay in but they are there because
they have a decent health care program
for themselves and their families think
what it means when young people are
anybody else can sell you a lot this is
the job of this is what I want to do and
I'm gonna do this work and I don't have
to worry about health care because all
of us in america have health care
and by the way what a Medicare for All
system will bring about is ending the
absurdity of the american people paying
by fall the highest prices in the world
for prescription drugs now when I talk
about democratic socialism what that
means to me is that in the year two
thousand and 15 a college degree today
is equivalent to what a high school
degree was fifty years ago and what that
means is that public education must
today
allow every person in this country who
have has the ability the qualifications
and the desire the right to go to a
public college or university tuition
free
radical socialistic idea I don't think
so
it exists in many countries all over the
world and you know what used to exist in
the united states of america we are
great universities like University of
California the City University of New
York virtually tuition free democratic
socialism means that our government does
everything it can to create a full
employment economy it makes far more
sense to me to put millions of people
back to work rebuilding our crumbling
infrastructure then to have a real
unemployment rate of almost 10% it is
far smaller to invest in jobs and
educational opportunities for young
people who are unemployed then to lock
them up and invest in jails and
incarceration
products socialism means that a somebody
works 40 hours a week that person should
not be living in poverty that we must
raise the minimum wage to a living wage
15 bucks a towel over the next several
years
it means that we join the rest of the
world and pass the very strong paid
Family and Medical Leave legislation now
sitting in congress
think about this want you to see what
goes on in our country today it's not
only that every other major country
virtually every country in the world
poor countries country reached the
conclusion that when a woman has a baby
she should not be forced to be separated
from that newborn baby after a week or
two and have to go back to work making
sure that moms and dads can stay home
and get to love their babies is a family
value that we should support and that is
why I want and will fight to end the
absurdity of the United States being one
of the only countries on earth that does
not guarantee at least three months of
paid Family and Medical Leave
democratic socialism to me means that we
have government policy
strong government policy which does not
allow the greed and profiteering of the
fossil fuel industry to destroy our
environment and our planet
and it means today that we have a moral
responsibility to combat climate change
and leave this planet healthy and
habitable for our kids and our
grandchildren
democratic socialism beings that in a
democratic civilised society the
wealthiest people in the largest
corporations must pay their fair share
of taxes
yes innovation entrepreneurial ship and
business success should be rewarded by
greed for the sake of greed is not
something that public policy should
support
it is not acceptable to me that in the
last period of time last two years
fifteen of the wealthiest people in this
country fifteen people saw their wealth
increase in this room economy by a
hundred and seventy billion dollars got
it two years fifteen people a hundred
and seventy billion dollars increase in
there well that is more wealth than is
owned by the bottom one hundred and
thirty million Americans let us not
forget what Pope Francis has so
elegantly stated and i quote we have
created new idols the worship of the
Golden Calf of old has found a new and
thoughtless image in the cult of money
and the dictatorship of an economy which
is faceless and lacking any truly you
main goal and the other works
we've got to do better than that not a
political issue it's not an economic
issue it is a cultural issue we have got
to stop worshiping people make billions
and billions and billions of dollars
while we have the highest rate of
childhood poverty of any major country
is not acceptable to me that major
corporations stashed their profits in
the Cayman Islands and other tax havens
to avoid paying one hundred billion
dollars a year in taxes it is not
acceptable that hedge fund managers pay
a lower effective tax rate for nurses or
truck drivers it is not acceptable that
billionaire families are able to leave
virtually all of their wealth to their
families without paying a reasonable
estate tax it is not acceptable that
Wall Street speculators are able
to gamble trillions of dollars in the
derivatives market without paying a
nickel in taxes on that speculation
democratic socialism to me does not just
mean that we must create a nation of
economic and social justice and
environmental Saturday of course it does
mean that but it also means that we must
create a vibrant democracy based on the
principle of one person one vote it is
extremely safe and I hope all of you
will pay a lot of attention to this
issue it is extremely sad that the
United States one of the oldest most
stable democracies in the world has one
of the lowest voter turnout of any major
country and that millions of young
people and working people have given up
on the political process entirely in the
last midterm election just a year ago
sixty-three percent of the American
people didn't vote eighty percent of
young people did not vote clearly
despite the efforts of many republican
governors who want to suppress the vote
to make it harder for people of color in
old people to participate in the
political system our job together is to
make it easier for people to vote not
hard for people to the
it is not a radical idea and I will
fight for this as hard as I can as
president to say that everyone in this
country who was 18 years of age or older
is registered to vote
end of discussion
so the next time that you hear be
attacked as a socialist like tomorrow
remember this I don't believe government
should take over the grocery store down
the street
production but I do believe that the
middle class and the working families of
this country who produce the wealth of
this country deserve a decent standard
of living and that their incomes should
go up not down I do believe in private
companies that thrive and invest and
grow in america companies that create
jobs here rather than companies that are
shutting down in america and increasing
their profits by exploiting low-wage
labor abroad
I believe that most Americans can pay
lower taxes if hedge fund managers who
make billions manipulating the market
place finally start paying the taxes
that they should I don't believe in
special treatment for the top one
percent but I do believe in equal
treatment for african-americans who are
right to proclaim the moral principle
that black lives
metal
I despise appeals to nativism and
Prejudice a lot of which we have been
hearing in recent months and I do
probably believe in immigration reform
a pathway to citizenship and a better
life
while subject let me just say real world
of concern to what I've been hearing
from some Republican candidates for
president in recent months people can
have honest disagreements about
immigration or anything else
democracy but people should not be using
the political process to inject racism
into the debate
Donald Trump and others referred to
latinos as people from mexico is
criminals and rapists if they want to
open that door our job is to shut that
door and shut it tight
this country has gone to fall too many
people have suffered too many people
have died for us to continue during
races words coming from major political
leaders now I don't believe in some
foreign is but I do believe in american
idealism and one of the pleasures of
experience on this campaign so far being
here today with you
the country huge numbers of young people
were coming
want to make this country better want to
use their intelligence in their energy
to address the many problems that we
have so I want to thank all of the young
people
country idealism do not become I am NOT
running for president because it is my
turn I was born in a three and a half
will apartment in a working-class family
in Brooklyn New York I don't think
by the way I visited California and
seriousness it is quite my turn that's
not why I'm running for president but I
am running for president in order for
all of us to be able to live in a nation
of hope and opportunity not for some but
for my seven grandchildren and for all
of you
nobody understood the connection between
american strength at home and our
ability to defend america around the
world and that is why he proposed a
second bill of rights in 1944 up any
said in that very same state of the
union and I quote again america's own
rightful place in the world depends in
large part upon health fully these and
similar rights have been carried into
practice for all our citizens for unless
there is security here at home there
cannot be lasting peace lasting peace in
the world and I am NOT running for
president
to pursue reckless adventures abroad but
to rebuild america's strength at home I
will never hesitate to defend this
nation but I will never send our sons
and daughters to war under false
pretense or pre cancers about dubious
battles with no end in sight
and as we discuss foreign policy I know
that all of you share with me your shock
horror at what happened in Paris and you
share with me your condolences to the
families who lost loved ones in your
hopes and prayers that those who were
wounded will recover and also those same
thoughts go out to the families of those
who lost loved ones in the russian like
that we believe I was taken down by
indices bomb and also those who lost
their lives to terrorist attacks in
lebanon and elsewhere to my mind it is
clear that the United States must pursue
policies to destroy the brutal and to
create conditions that prevent fanatical
extremist ideologies from flourishing
but we cannot and should not do it alone
our response must begin with an
understanding of past mistakes and
missteps in our previous approaches to
foreign policy it begins with the
acknowledgement that unilateral military
action should be a last resort not a
first resort
and ill-conceived military decisions
such as the invasion of Iraq can wreak
far-reaching devastation and
destabilization over regions for decades
that the found policy decisions of the
past
russia into war regime change in Iraq
war toppling Mohammad Mossadegh in I ran
in 1953 was the president CIA and others
got rid of them to protect British
Petroleum interests the Shah of Iran's
came in a brutal dictator and he was
thrown out by the Islamic Revolution and
that is where we are and I ran today
decisions have consequences orphan
unintended consequences so whether it
was saddam hussein
attack or Guatemalan President events in
1954 Guatemalan Brazilian President
galore in 1964 Chilean President
Salvador Allende in 1973 this type of
regime change this type of throwing
overthrowing governments we may not like
all thing does not work often makes a
bad and difficult decision even worse
these are lessons we must learn
after World War 2 ww2 in response to the
fear of soviet aggression European
nations and the United States
established nato the north american
Treaty Organization an organization
based on shared interests and goals and
the notion of a collective defense
against a common enemy it is my belief
that we must expand on these ideals and
solidify our commitments to work
together to combat the global threat of
terror we must create a new organization
like nato to confront the security
threats of the 21st century and
organization that emphasizes cooperation
and collaboration to defeat the rise of
violent extremism any importantly to
address the root causes on the line
these brutal acts we must work with our
nato partners we must work to expand the
coalition with russia and we must work
with members of the Arab League but let
us be very clear while the United States
and other Western nations how bush
strength of our military and our
political system's the fight against
Isis is a struggle for the soul of Islam
and countering violent extremism and
destroying Isis must be drawn primarily
by Muslim nations with the strong
support of their global partners
long before Paris but I am very happy to
tell you that these same sentiments have
been echoed by people like Jordan's King
Abdullah the second in a speech just
Sunday in which he said that terrorism
is the greatest threat to our region the
gulf region Middle East and that Muslims
must lead the fight against he noted
that confronting extremism is both a
regional and international
responsibilities and that it is
incumbent on Muslim nations and
communities to confront those who seek
to hijack their societies and their
religion with generations of intolerance
and violent ideology and let me
congratulate King Abdullah not only for
his wise remarks but also for the role
that his small country is playing only
for his wise remarks but also for the
role that his small country is playing
in attempting to address the horrific to
combat Isis
to seal the borders that fighters are
currently flowing across to share
counterterrorism intelligence to turn
off the spigot of terrorist financing
end-to-end support for exploiting
extremist ideologies and what does that
mean what it means is that in many cases
we must ask more from those countries in
the Gulf region while Jordan Turkey
Egypt and Lebanon in their own ways have
accepted their responsibilities for
taking in Syrian refugees other
countries in the region have done
nothing or very little equally important
and this is a point that may make some
people uncomfortable but it is a client
that must be made countries in the
region like Saudi Arabia Kuwait Qatar
the UAE countries of enormous wealth and
resources have contributed far too
little in the fight against Isis that
must change
absolutely right when he says the Muslim
nations must lead the fight against and
that includes and must include some of
the most wealthy and powerful nations in
the region to this point have done too
little Saudi Arabia turns out has the
third largest defense budget in the
world yet instead of fighting I says
they are focused more on a campaign to
oust I ran back hootie rebels in Yemen
Kuwait a country whose ruling family was
restored to power by the United States
driving saddam hussein's iraq out of
kuwait has been a well-known kuwait
people in kuwait have been well known
sources of financing for Isis and other
violent extremists it has been reported
the cutoff will spend up to two hundred
billion dollars on the 2000 and 22 World
Cup including the construction of an
enormous number of facilities to host
that event 200 billion on hosting a
soccer event yet very little to fight
Isis were still it has been widely
reported that the government there has
not been vigilant in stemming the flow
of terrorist financing and the Qatari
individuals and organizations funnel
money to some of the most extreme
terrorist groups in the region all this
has got to change
wealthy and powerful Muslim nations in
the region can no longer sit on the
sidelines and expect the United States
our young men in
women and our taxpayers to do it for
them they have got to come up to the
plate
as we develop a strongly coordinated
effort we need a commitment from these
countries that the fight against Isis
takes precedence over the religious and
ideological differences that handful the
kind of cooperation that we desperately
need further we all understand that
Bashar al-assad president of syria is a
brutal dictator who has lauded many of
his own people I am pleased that we saw
last weekend
diplomats from all over the world known
as the International serious support
group set a timetable for a syrian-led
political transition with an open and
fair election these are the promising
beginnings of a collective effort to end
the bloodshed and move toward a
political transition in Syria the double
up diplomatic plan for Assad transition
from paula is a good step in a united
front but our major priority must be to
defeat Isis nations all over the world
who share a common interest in
protecting themselves against
international terrorism must make the
destruction of Isis the highest priority
nations in the region must admit that
instead of turning a blind eye they will
commit their resources to preventing the
free flow of terrorists financials and
fighters to Syria and Iraq we need a
commitment that they will count the
violent rhetoric that fuels terrorism
river that often occurs within their
borders
this is the model which we must pursue
in order to address the global threats
that we face while individual donations
obviously have historic dispute the
united states and russia now very strong
differences of opinion on some very
serious issues I ran in saudi arabia to
put it mildly
do not like each other but the time is
now to do everything possible to put
aside those differences to work toward a
common goal of destroying Isis sadly as
we have seen recently no country is
immune from attacks by the violent
organization called Isis does we must
work with our partners in europe the
Gulf region Africa and Southeast Asia
all along the way
asking the hard questions whether their
actions are serving how unified purpose
the bottom line is that I says must be
destroyed but it cannot be defeated by
the United States alone a new and
effective coalition must be formed with
the Muslim nations leading the effort on
the ground while the United States and
other major forces provide the support
they need
let me conclude once again thanking all
of you for being here today all across
this country is elimination from the
political process people look to
washington and they throw their hands up
and they say what in God's name is going
on there why you are into our senators
and congressmen paying attention to our
needs why are we developing a rational
farm policy rather than talking again
about getting involved in the Middle
East which could lead to perpetual
conclude just by saying this the
problems that we face as a nation are
indeed very very serious like talk talk
talk on some there's a lot we haven't
even touched upon but by in large
all of these problems were caused by bad
human decisions if we come together if
we stand together if we do not allow
ourselves to be divided up by race by
whether we gave weather wish rate was
born in America we weren't born in
america whether a male or female if we
stand together and if we focus on how we
can create same foreign policy how we
can rebuild the middle class how we can
combat climate change how we can create
a nation in which we end racism and
homophobia if we are prepared to do that
if you as young people are prepared to
engage in the political process I have
no doubt that there is nothing nothing
nothing that together we cannot
accomplish thank you all very much

their special claim to fame with not
just that they produced a fantastic
ice cream and dozens of weird flavors
but that they were also great
employers supporters Obermeyer
agriculture
in champions of the environment ben
jerry's show the world that one could be
a successful
and profitable company while at the same
time maintaining progressive
ideals in recent years enduring have
been increasingly concerned
about the power of big money in politics
and what it's doing to our democracy
please welcome back Cohen and Jerry
Greenfield
%uh
the
the
the one
and honor Ford van and me to be here
supporting Bernie Sanders a man who for
all over
thirty years has been fighting for
fairness
and against injustice and I feel so
lucky
and millions of Americans
across the country are lucky that we can
now
join bernie in this fight the
you know
front-runner business as usual politics
from either party is just more of the
same
more money for the ultra-wealthy and
nice for everybody else
more profits for oil companies and less
clean air debris
more money for jails and defense
contractors
and pharmaceutical companies and less
money for schools
lifting people out of poverty and
creating a healthier society
both physically and spiritually
this system isn't broken it fixed
it's great it's no accident
that corporate profits through through
the room while wages are stagnant
it's no accident that ninety percent of
the wealth created in the last five
years
has gone to the top one percent the laws
are written by politicians
to please the corporations and the
ultra-wealthy
who bought those politicians with
millions of dollars
up so-called political campaign
contributions
otherwise known as legalized bribery
the and Bernie s led the fight to put an
end to it
unlike some johnny-come-lately stew the
issues
bernie is the real thing %uh
he's not about reading the polls and
figuring out what he needs to say in
order to get elected
he said now and unwavering commitment
to basic Justice a quality and sound
financial sets
the
I mean the guys been saying and doing
the same stuff for the last thirty years
in
if he weren't so inspiring he'd be
pouring he's about leading with his
heart and his soul
and using his brain to do what's best
for the little guy
the guy who is ignored by the political
elite
until it's time to ask for their book
you know some say that voting for Bernie
is throwing your vote away %uh
I they say that voting for anyone else
is flushing our country down the drain
%uh
the the
and you know sometimes the underdog
links
in the early days depending Jerry
when we were barely available outside
firm are
the pillsbury corporation owners have
Haagen Dazs
were illegally trying to put us out of
business
we couldn't afford to fight them in
court
but we took our case to the people
an appeal to their sense of fairness and
one
%uh and the country found out what the
Doughboy I was afraid
this is a guy with the
vision and that got sent the smarts to
return America to what made our country
great
in the first place for those who have
been sitting on the sidelines
finally a candidate worth voting for
the
and you know what if we all get all of
our butts
and work for any bernie will def by
the experts once again and he'll wear
the
the
you know in the end there's a spiritual
dimension to all this
as Tracy Chapman saying hunger for a
tasty justice
hunger only for a world that truth
costs all that you have is your sole
so let this be the start
up the Bernie rebellion the
a rebellion against big money in
politics that has corrupted our
government a rebellion against
inequality and shoving marginalize

we are going to take this campaign
directly to the people in town meetings
daughter door conversations on street
corners
and its social media the
this week we're gonna be in new
hampshire
we're gonna be an Iowa and we're gonna
be in Minnesota
and that is just a thought August archer
okay
%uh out
let me be clear this campaign
is not about Bernie Sanders it's not
about hillary Clinton it is not about
jeb bush or anyone else this campaign
is about but needs of the american
people
%uh
and the ideas and proposals
that up effectively addressed does the
as someone who has never run
a naked up political ad in my life
%uh
my campaign will not be driven
white political gossip or reckless
personal attacks out
this is wat the American people
wat and deserved these are serious times
weenie serious debates %uh
politics
in a democratic society should not be
treated
as if it were a baseball game
eight-game gameshow or a salt
opera and I hope to me dr
understand side as well %uh
let me take a minute
to touch on some of the issues then I
will be focusing on in the coming month
and then give you a brief outline
arbitrage and up for
America up and agenda which in fact
will deal with the serious problems and
lead us
to a better future today
today we live in a nation which is the
wealthiest nation in the history of the
world
what got reality means very little
for most robust because almost all of
that wealth
is owned and controlled by a tiny
handful of individuals in america
we now have wat income and wealth
inequality
than any other major country on earth
and the gap between
not very rich should everyone else if
growing
wider NY the airshow
while and income inequality is for great
moral issue of our time it is for
greater economic issue
of our time it is for great political
issue
all about I'm and we well address it
%uh
and
like me
be very clear and let the clock
1 percent understand this there is
something profoundly wrong
when the top 110 up 1 percent
owns own both of us much well ever
bottom ninety percent
and when ninety-nine percent all
no income go through the top what
percent
there is something profoundly wrong
where in recent years we have seen a
proliferation of millionaires
and billionaires at the same time X
millions of Americans
are working longer hours polo wagers
and we have shamefully the highest rate
our childhood poverty of any major
country
there is something profoundly wrong
went 1 family one family
all swallow wealth in this country than
the bottom
130 million Americans
this grotesque level
update equality is the moral it is bad
economics
it is unsustainable this type of
wreck the economy if not what america
is supposed to be about this has got to
change
and as your president took cab up we are
going to change it
one it's not just
income and wealth inequality it is a
tragic reality
that for the last forty years great
middle-class
about country 13 NV up the entire world
has been disappearing despite
exploding technology and increased
worker productivity
median family income is almost five
thousand dollars less today
that it was in 1999 in our great state
and all over this country people are
working not one drop
but to drop three jobs trying to cobble
together
any car and some healthcare back is not
acceptable we can inbox do better
the truth there's the real unemployment
is not
5.4 percent what you read in the papers
it is close to 11 percent youth
unemployment seventy percent
african-american youth unemployment
of but rocks today
shamefully we are 45 million people
living in poverty
many of whom are working and low-wage
job in america today despite the gains
of the Affordable Care Act 35 million
Americans
still lack any help injured my friends
diana is the reality
upper-middle-class in america today
and not is a reality not just for our
what for our kids and our grandchildren
that we
are going to change
my fellow americans love me as
want be as blunt as I can and tell you
what you already know
as a result other disastrous Supreme
Court decision
I'm citizens united the American
political system
has been totally corrupted and the
foundations of American democracy
on now being undermine what the supreme
court said
sexually was that it was not good enough
with the billionaires own March up the
economy
they could now all the United States
government
as well and that is precisely what
they are trying to do
now when I learned in school and I they
quickly many women who put their lives
on the line to defend our country
have long know that american democracy
is not about billionaires
being able to buy candidates and by
election
it is thought about the Koch brothers
Sheldon Adelson
and other incredibly wealthy individuals
spending billions of dollars
to elect candidates who will make the
rich richer
and everyone else poor according to
media reports that you can't believe it
the Koch brothers in this election cycle
are prepared to spend more money but I
believe the Democratic
or Republican Party's that is not
democracy
that is oligarchy
in vermont throughout town meetings we
know what democracy is about that as one
person
one-vote and not for karnal political
system
we are going to fight law and are going
to achieve
now when we talk about
our responsibilities as human beings
that as per
there's nothing more important leaving
this country and the entire planet
in a way that is habitable for our kids
and our grandchildren
but the bay is over scientific community
has spoken
in a virtually unanimous boys climate
change is real
it is caused by human activity and is
already causing
devastating problems in our country and
around the world and let's be clear
if we do not get our act together
and happy United slates leave the world
in combat in climate change there will
be a boy drowned more
famine more rising sea level wat wud
warm ocean acidification more
extreme weather disturbances airs
human being will work out all well
this environment who appreciate
the beauty that we have on this planet
we are not going to allow
a fossil fuel industry the Detroit
their line
out
brothers and sisters it is no secret
that there is massive discontent with
politics in america today
in the last picture malek should some 63
percent of Americans
did not bowl including eighty percent
young people
poll after poll tells of that all
citizens no longer have confidence
in our political institutions and given
the power a big-money
in the political process in general they
understand
that their pain is not being
heard washing and that people in
washington
elected official much wat concern about
the lobbyists
and the billionaire the suffering
ordinary
now combat ng this political
alienation this it is and this
legitimate
angle will not be easy that's for sure
but that is exactly
what gavel we machst du
if we're going to turn this country
around
and that is what this campaign is all
about
and if we are going to bring people
together
we need a simple straightforward
progressive agenda which speaks to the
need
up the American people and provide
software
a vision are they very different America
and what his father John let me briefly
tell you when I think the agenda begins
with
job job and more jobs if we are serious
about reversing the client the middle
class
we need a may drop federal jobs program
which put millions of people back to
work
a good paying jobs at a time when our
roads our bridges
our water system rail and airport of the
caning
about the fact that way to rapidly
create
meaningful jobs is to rebuild our
crumbling
infrastructure
and that is why I
introduce legislation which would at
best one trillion dollars over five
years
to modernize our country's physical
infrastructure of legislation that would
create
and maintain third she million
good-paying jobs
and if you're president
I will lead the effort to make sure what
that legislation
this past I will also continue to oppose
our current trade policy what de que
presidents from both parties have
supported trade agreements which are
poor start
million up decent paying jobs as
corporate america
shot down plants in vermont throughout
this country
and moves to low-wage country as
president might trade policies
will break not cycle of agreements which
rich
but few at the expense up too many
lot of also be on earth
and acknowledge that today million
of american workers on now working poor
totally
inadequate wages the car in
federal minimum wage up seven and a
quarter now are
is a start they should wage and Mark be
raised
not minimum wage in this country
marked b.com a living wage which be
which believes raising it the fifteen
dollars an hour
over the next few years old
our goal
not a radical idea when our goal must be
that any worker
in this country who worked 40 hours a
week
is not living in poverty Burgaw
we must stop large pay equity for women
workers
it is unconscionable that women earn 78
cents on the dollar
compared to men will perform the same
work
we must also revived our
overtime standards so that people
people make it 25 with 30,000 now 30,000
a year
who are working 50 60 hours a week
get time and a half
and and we need paid sick leave
and guaranteed vacation time for every
worker
in this country this campaign
starting today is going to send a
message
the billionaire class and that is
you can't have it all you can't get
huge tax breaks while children in this
country
go hungry you can't continue
sending out job abroad wild million
are looking for work you can't hide your
property in the Cayman Islands
and other tax havens while they are on
math look unmet needs
on every corner up this nation total
billion a class of
I save that your degree has got to end.
you cannot take advantage all of the
benefits
America up if you refuse to accept your
responsibilities
and ideas why
we need a tax system which is fair
and Progresso which counsel wealthiest
individuals
and the largest corporations that they
are going to begin
to start paying their fair share our our
taxes
when we talk about power
we talk about Wall Street in my view
it is time to break up the largest
financial institutions
in this country Wall Street cannot
continue
to be an island unto itself gambling
trillion in risky financial instruments
while expecting the public the bail in
I'll
if a bank is too big to fail that bank
is topiary
to accept
if we are serious about a progressive
agenda that speaks to the D
of working families their talks about
climate change
and the needs about kids and the elderly
we marked
be focused on campaign finance reform
and a needed break constitutional
amendment
to overturn their interest Citizens
United decision
I am said it before and I'll say it
again
I will not nominate any justice
the Supreme Court who else not made it
clear that he or she
will mu to overturn that this actress
position
which is on the binding american
democracy longer-term
we need to go further in a stylish
public funding
on election I look to our future it is
clear to me
that the United States of America month
leave the world in reversing climate
change
weekend do not
like transforming our energy system
away from fossil fuels for energy
efficiency
and thought sustainable energy use when
so solar geothermal and biomass
brothers and sisters the United States
of America today
remains the only major country on earth
but does not guarantee health care
to all people as the right
despite the modest gains of the
Affordable Care Act 35 million Americans
continue to have no health insurance
an even more are under insurer
yet despite that pathetic record
we end up spending almost twice as much
per capita on health care is any all
about
nation in March strong a pic
United States March drawing the rest of
the industrialized world
and guarantee health care to all as a
right in
and we both stored through a Medicare
for All
single-payer program
out at a time
when millions of Americans are
struggling to keep their heads above
water economically
and a time when senior poverty is
increasing
at a time when millions of kids in this
country
don't get enough food the my Republican
colleagues
as part of their recently passed budget
are trying to make
a terrible situation even worth if you
can believe it and this is the true
the republican budget rose $27 million
Americans
awkward health insurance makes drastic
cuts in Medicare
growth billion low-income Americans
including
pregnant women of good nutrition
programs
and makes it hard on stroke and makes it
horrible working-class families
to afford college or put their kids
in the head start program
and then to add insult to injury
the republican budget provides you tax
breaks
for the very richest people in this
country while they raise taxes
on working family
well let me tell my Republican
colleagues
that I respectfully disagree
with their approach %uh instead of
cutting Social Security
we are going to expand social security
card
%uh instead of cutting head start
and child care we are going to move to a
universal
pre-k system for all the children of
this country as Franklin Delano
Roosevelt reminded of
a nation's greatness is George not quite
what it provides
to the most well-off wonder how it
treats the people
most Indy and dodi is what kind of
country
we must become %uh
and when we talk about education
let me make it very clear in a highly
competitive global economy
we need the best educated workforce we
can
create it is insane it is
counterproductive
to the best interests of our country
that 100
of thousands up right young people can
not
up Lloyd to go to college and that
millions of others
leave school with a mountain of debt
that burden them
put back in
this is not what a great country it's
about
that most and not it's why I as
president well
fight to make to we're sure in in public
colleges and universities free
%uh
as well as substantially lower interest
rates one student loans
and
the young people all over our country
our book young chop
they've gotta get the education they

difficult
and dangerous world and there are people
out there
who would do us harm as president I will

but begin the process up creating
conditions
well last week please out
as some love you know
I was born in a faraway land called
Brooklyn New York
my father came to this country
from poland without a penny in his
pocket
and having dropped out a school at a
young age
my mother graduated high school in New
York City
my father worked his entire life is a
pain
salesman never made much money
my parents and my brother and I live in
a small red control
apartment my mother's dream what's the
mood I love that
ball three and a half room apartment and
get a home
up her own she died young and her dream
was
noble bill as a kid I learned in many
many ways
everyday in my house what lack of money
means
to a family and that is the lesson
then I have noble begotten and never
will
forget in
I have three
I have seen as many of you have the
promise of America or
in our own life my parents nap
notebook nap when I'm bring that they
are fun
to become the United them let alone run
for president what put through many
about fellow American the dream progress
an opportunity
is being denied why the grind of an
economy
that funnel virtually all of the well
and although bn.com
to the top and to those who say
we cannot risk or withdrew ice age of
war
where we are standing today as love you

this beautiful place was once an
unsightly rail yard
that serve no public purpose it was an
eyesore
ever mayor I worked with the people of
Burlington
to help turn this waterfront into the
beautiful people oriented public space
it is still a
we talk bad fight
the courts the legislature and to the
people
and we won the lesson to be learned and
it is a profound political
lesson is that when people span
to get went people are prepared to fight
back
there is not think that cannot be
accomplished and
we
can live in our country where every
person out health care is a right
not a privilege we can live in a country
where every parent get a quality and
affordable trial cow
and where all of our qualified young
people to get a college education
regardless of their income we can live
in a country
where every senior up can live in
dignity and security and not be fourth
the truth between food and medicine
we can live in a country
where every veteran was quote him for
our life on the line
the bandits nation gets to how quality
health care
and benefits they are burned and deserve
we can live in a country
where every person no matter no matter
their race
their religion their disability or their
sexual orientation
realizes the full promise of equality
that is our birthright

me
ladies and gentleman we
stay around for another concert with
mango jailed

dollars every year to lock up fellow
Americans are clearly we can do a lot
better but we are not going to do a lot
better unless we break through some old
ideas and that's what this panel's about
this is a great pile of what we're going
to do after our panelists speak we're
going to open it up to you all talked
for a while and it was your ideas
this is gonna be a town meeting an
informal discussion to address a very
very serious issue and I without further
ado let me introduce the old woman who
has been a champion not just on this
issue comes from Cleveland but on issues
impacting glowing common working people
you know in america today their issues
were allowed to talk about issues were
not allowed to talk about poverty is one
of the issues apparently there were not
allowed to talk about
despite the fact that we have forty
seven million people living in poverty
center dot
does talk about poverty does talk about
the needs of working people does talk
about a broken criminal justice system
and we are so delighted that she's a lot
about campaign senator needed
country in this country
the problems that are facing this nation
are generational issues
Ohio State University President of the
United States
the land of the free home of the brave
come back home and we have a problem
that is going to take
middle-class black and brown
important that we all take a look at
what is happening in the criminal
justice system and start to treat folks
who come back out of that system and
welcome them back into our communities
and help them to be able to live out
their greatest greatness we do that
together
people who have their lives and orally
transforming their lives using their
lives to make sure that younger people
do not go through the same experiences
that they have gone through and I have
and I would hope all of you have just
the enormous respect for the courage
determination that they have shown so it
gives be a great deal of honor and a
privilege to introduce jerome miller is
a form of conflict has been in
penitentiary and he's gonna talk a
little bit about his life he's welcome
Andrew Miller
three years here in Iowa for drugs and I
have three years in Colorado for drugs I
came out in 2008 so I'm home about five
years when we did things that kept me
home is the fact that I got tired of
what was my self and I figured out stock
take control of my life I've met anybody
else write the book about troubles
school this is like the latter part of
my life is tough for me to take my book
wrapped up in it right the rest of my
story and make my happened
one of the reasons that I was able to
get out of change I did myself decided
to do things I'm studying just to stay
and that's sitting around talking just
to talk with congress has seen the probe
boy 18 months after 35 years with a team
of mandatory sentence I see the board in
eighteen months and they told me I don't
have enough time so they said we might
see next year I wrote them and say thank
you give me the opportunity I understand
have 35 years and maybe i'll be
satisfied with his eighteen months
however I will see you again and I will
continue doing the things that happened
I seen here they ask me a question is
very important question is that the
senator from Ohio had he said why should
we let you go home and I say because of
still useful please do not put me inside
the warehouse on a show and let me say I
am useful I can use my experiences that
all good to help those who unfortunately
may be traveling the way that I have
traveled five years later I am now in my
master degree in Drake I dropped out it
is great in 1988 and Gary G the New York
State Penitentiary and now again I mean
my master's degree
that most of family members are
incarcerated in the apt to go through
work-release probably would be forced to
me and when you go to 42 morning they
give you piece of paper and they tell
you to go find a job that's all they do
well I haven't been used the
penitentiary three here again and in
those three years I have been to a lot
of things and I had to learn how to deal
with with no help so I've learned how to
do with myself without those reports
that the senators were mentioning a prob
be back and I did have been exports I
own my own agency no reason why all my
own agencies because nobody would give
me a job and my job to do something
that's behavior helping to ensure I have
been apparent partner for those who
don't know that I was a people who help
other people who have lost eight
children because of drugs of choice for
them to jump through hoops at the ages
and do what they need to do to get the
children I feel great all those things
in those things keep me free I believe
that if you give somebody the
opportunity to serve special just coming
out the attack that opportunity and a
lot of them will stay
we won't see all this going back with
Dad I'm gonna pass it on to senator
thank you very much the attack
very much very honored to introduce
rueben johnson rubin similar way to draw
has also experienced the inside of a
penitentiary please welcome rueben
johnson thank you are a lot of cases a
lot of cases that does not exist does
not exist unless you have some family
support unless you have some gentleman
who have been in prison I can speak
directly to you about their experiences
nine times out of 10 they have nothing
to speak about my experience when I left
the jury in Illinois I was released from
joliet state penitentiary the day before
I was released I did not know I was
going to be released had no idea so
someone finally came to my cell said
packaged up you going home
great exciting I'm wondering what the
next steps will be driving those next
steps so when I'm when I get released I
get taken to the front door of the state
prison to await my ride they give me a
time believed it had $75 and perhaps and
that was it was a little late they tell
me to sit on a bench and weight I didn't
know what to expect
yet I was expecting something in my mind
I was like should I be getting something
is there no paperwork
steps and I need to follow when I get
back out nothing my brother comes to
pick me up his unlicensed driver he's X
fell when I get in the car he has
marijuana and drink for me
congratulations glad you home let's
party unfortunately I am impoverish I
have to go back to my home my friends
these are my friends they say man I'm
glad you're home and it went to give me
things during legal to allow me to get
some money so that they say you get back
on your feet
these are my friends enforcing this all
I had available to me at that point
that's not what I wanted but I didn't
know where else to look I felt as if I
should want something else but I didn't
know where else to look site so here I
kinda expected I would be released I
went to see the parole board similar and
in the parole board meeting they have a
list of questions that they typically
action and these are list of questions
that they axe everybody different cases
different demographics different
understandings different backgrounds
questions for everybody
eventually because I may be in 2004 the
questions so I asked the crisis in the
manner in which to parole officers and
their grandma perot that's not to say I
hadn't changed I had learned anything
why did learn something I learned what
they wanted to hear when they ask these
questions any benefit me so I was able
to be released from prison while I was
in prison have programs that you must be
a part of your response but when I'm in
prison to those programs is to show I
have to show up and sign my name that I
was here from that point I could fall
asleep the instructor does not work in
the prison he has no responsibility
whatsoever to ensure that I follow this
program or even learn from the program
he's being paid to show up and
facilitated class and he does that to my
understanding probably doesn't work out
I'll probably
he does it well so i didnt gathered that
much from that idea gained something
that I found out about it gathered that
much from that so apparent in the
granite to perot to be released
account like the same thing happened
over again I'm expecting something I
feel like something soon happen so they
tell me I'm going to work release center
he mentioned in its support to more like
okay so I understand that there will be
a little bit more development maybe some
skills training if you will I don't know
but no not not not at all you get there
you have to establish a banking account
because they want to keep track and
manage your money for you
they're nice that way they will also
give you the piece of paper that he
mentioned where you must go out and you
find a job now kinda like what's wrong
said what's wrong came out me and him
and I was able to assist him with finest
employment that he became successful way
I was able to develop him to the point
where he was able to run off on his own
to find that development that's almost
was my expect expectation in this work
release center but that's not what they
do again they'll just give you this
piece of paper and they require you to
go out and get that job I was not from
the Morni why do I knew nothing about
the morning I was a really didn't have
them when I want free and I didn't know
where employers was I didn't even have
work experience on my resume is gonna be
takin it had dropped out of school so I
don't have a full level of education
either if not for a friend of mine who
happened to be incarcerated telling me
you know they hired me over here and
they're still hiring they'd like us you
need to come out here so I went out
there the interview process is very
simple
probably could they just want to feel
cease to try to feel their full-time
employee quota and I met that so they
hired me but if not for that gentleman
introducing me to that I would not have
had that opportunity but it turns out is
the same employment opportunity talked
about and we made it a point to go out
and seek individuals who were just
recently let out of prison who didn't
have many skills are many educational
opportunities and we brought them in
right I won't take up too much more
determined to make sure you maybe you
actually later on but throughout my time
was released from prison in 1999 and to
this day I have a receipt of aidid I'm
proud of that I haven't even thought
about that thank you thank you I
appreciate it
that's my job that's what I should be
doing but throughout that time I have
met and I cannot even count among my
hand how many I'm no one special but I
have meant I can't count among my hand
without roughly see about 15 different
male individuals who if I hadn't had the
experiences that I had to make me a
little upset angry and I want to make
sure that this gentleman doesn't go to
that either they're about roughly 10 to
15 individuals who have have felony
records in our model was supposed to
socialize with wife had given them an
opportunity in their life today they
have never been back to prison want
their gainfully employed summer pursuing
her master's degrees in college I mean
they're making so many improvements
they're getting married they're not even
running the streets in that type of
matter anymore
some of cannot drink some of stop
drinking I don't take credit for it what
I do know is I gave them the motivation
to be able to pursue their dreams in a
manner however legally this was
something that I was not supposed to be
able to do legally this was something
that I was not supposed to do I want you
guys to think about that if this young
lady accidentally makes a mistake in her
life and they consider it fell in
felonious a felon she is removed as a
resource from just about everybody else
in this room if we were and I don't
think that's fair because I know she has
something and I'll be able to benefit
from something that'll be able to impact
my life what does that mean we are
giving back to our community we're
giving back to our families were giving
back to our country in this particular
manner that's all I have a will take up
too much time thank you guys for allow
me to come here and speak in this manner
but I do hope that this allows us to
open on my open our eyes to the
demographic that we are singling out
we're targeting I understand that
they're criminals out there need to be
in prison but we have to make sure we're
doing our weights and balances we get
the right people in the right places
a long speech what I want to do is open
let me throw out some questions that
maybe we may want to think about why is
it that in America we have so many
people in jail
number one why is it disproportionately
black and brown what are some of the
laws out there
minimum sentencing so-called war on
drugs what impact does all of that house
on the high rates of incarceration in
America are we doing anything close to
what we should be doing in terms of
dealing with high rates of recidivism in
other words you heard both of these guys
talking about you know when you come out
of jail is there a path is there other
programs available to help you get your
feet back on the ground or you simply
given a piece of paper and save 75 bucks
and good luck to you and if that's the
case why is not surprising that so many
people end up back in jail so those are
just some of the issues that come to the
top of my my other issues out there that
we didn't talk about art and I'm the
former chairman its interest former
chairman of the Senate Veterans
Committee and in somehow I think there's
some kind of correlations a relationship
with people come home for what about the
wives girlfriends in the children how
they impact on this whole process that
were the talk about what percentage of
kids whose parents are in jail with
themselves end up in jail
the answer is obviously it's a very very
high percentage but if Dad is arrested
in goes the job of the family so some of
my questions are you have other
questions let's open up so just
introduce yourself
be as loud as you can only hope Michael
Cedar Rapids hold up my clothes over
there we we welcome you and your guests
here today one of the questions that
came up to us while we were just sitting
here is what about having the voting
rights restored to think about
and I have the numbers varied here in my
speech but I'll give it over to draw
well governor we all make mistakes and
makes worst mistakes and others and if a
person has proved to be able to think
now more productive way I think certain
rights should be restored so they can be
a full citizen of this country we have a
lot to offer I mean right now as
second-class citizens
that's something that will make me hope
you know
able to do the things I do when I have
came as far as I came in five years
because I have a purpose other purpose
than anybody X card beautiful person for
the job of a life happens when you
retire you know lost like leader purpose
right so helping allow us to help this
is democracy that we have will help us
feel like part in that outside inside
the lawn outside outlaws enough
13% 13%
anyone thinks by the way just like to
point out that almost made the main
point you did you time to time you saw
it
why should that crime take away your
right to participate in american
democracy now there are states like my
by the way with the limbs to vote and we
have got to make that universal people
have paid their price but that does not
mean they should not be able to
participate in the democratic system
very very good question are at four
percent of people in jails and prisons
have some sort of mental health
challenge and you mentioned earlier that
is a word that we don't like to talk
about mental health is something that is
a huge contributing factor to people
ending up in jails and prisons and
especially in the state of Iowa we just
closed two of our mental health
facilities I know the governor would
like to close a third and when people
have nowhere to go for mental health
treatment often times they end up in
jail or prison so
to the point right away
absolutely great our time and ask these
guys need a job as well
mental health issues people behind bars
what's the correlation what's the
speakers speaking about the
african-american community and other
minority communities go to something
that is has always been somewhat
downplayed region to be very secretive
far as that's concerned access ability
to get to a mental health facility is
another thing that might interfere with
a person getting that so most minorities
do get their medical treatment while
incarcerated in the treatment they learn
how to deal with it
come home we maybe six months worth of
medication if they have medication and
so we don't have no rights to go back in
they call themselves and some medicated
so we have some services that connects
from the penitentiary to society
rubin Hansen and I'm going to ask you
guys to think about what percentage of
people I don't know of anyone does but
what percentage of people behind bars in
fact or medicated is there a lot of
medicine
I don't know too much about the mental
health in a clinical diagnosis would
have to be honest with you I'm skeptical
of it I know it's used as a tool is it's
it's especially for younger people
that's when they started out you know
about his nose you with a problem right
here I guess that's the reason why I'm
sending you to prison later on down the
line you can't learn your enable to
change there's you have issues you have
mental health let's go ahead and get him
incarcerated because before you get
incarcerated as they so you dream that
there's rehabilitation is true but there
seem to be able to address once you're
incarcerated not troops are they going
to what you're talking about
that's where the medication comes in it
I'm the doctor in the prison it's a
prison it's really big I got a lot of
people who were considered clinically or
mental health issues where I would
rather just medicate some that I don't
want to deal with no service on that I
do so the medication rate is high so you
end up coming out of prison and I need
to sustain bed so that I don't want some
of the people in prison or on that
occasion yes and when they got out of
prison what happens when they get out of
prison that medication becomes more to
the financial room now there's a huge
benefit and it's so particularly
probably can't afford it right so you go
to the alternative I don't know you know
if you pay attention to the news of you
do studies right they go from prescribe
medication that makes you feel some type
of way to go find that drugs on the
street so whether it's something to make
you feel relaxed Michael find marijuana
heroin but something made you feel hyper
you might go find cocaine or whatever
the case may be right so it's just again
the coping mechanism whether it's mental
help with this guy that was in prison
with the guy that doesn't have support
whatever you going to try to find what
you can do to cope because there's
nothing out here to help you
plotted it is the gap right because
again they just let you out it's not I
let you out in the visa services going
around right so we can make sure that
you still at which helps the person who
just came out of it provides jobs for
individuals
things that I let me jump in and ask a
question
rubin's those tell me if I got it right
let you how was 75 bucks right ok
75 bucks many people who get out have
been receiving medication in jail in a
limited amount money you don't have a
job you may not have job training and
yep I'm about the suite of it is I
represented as a significant amount of
money as individual to the prison
complex and they are determined to get
their money so even when you're out you
owe them their money they typically say
restitution they might see a state like
your paper you paid your paper you
eventually you pay for the medication
that you were giving them their you pay
for all the services you pay for the
treatment but it is not itemized on that
building just lumped into one so-called
restitution if you will and has not
taken off you will you like just getting
out of jail without a job but in the UK
for supervision so yeah right
assumption that you have the $300
doesn't matter who you guys know this is
my only person was rumored into this if
you go to Polk County stake in its
contractual so they give you piece of
paper that you sign your name or
nickname I can we take what happens you
will be charged but you probably won't
go to write you probably be paid because
that's what they need to do but you
might just get along
art so what we're hearing is your lease
no job no source of income
75 bucks maybe in your pocket you may be
on medications which have created a
certain feeling in you that you're going
to have to deal with the outside and on
top of that money nobody like you had a
case manager say every X every person is
about to leave out a statement
attributable to each entry had a case
manager that person would be somebody
there to organize these services around
that one person is no money in the mail
and we have to come to grips with that
in the question about mental health and
I'm so glad that the young lady brought
that up most of the women and we have to
talk about women in the sisters who are
in prison right now most women are
non-violent offenders as well so we're
locking them up many of them not all
because we need to care about single
women as well as single men and women
don't have children but then just think
about the women who do have children I
will compounding that because lots of
homes especially in poor communities and
especially in african-american
communities are single mother here
household over 70% of the mama is locked
up where are the resources for the
children but to her mental health point
lots of women are on that mental health
track and they don't have the support
that they need when they come out so we
should not be surprised and I'm with you
tsunami that the charging of folks but
we should not be surprised as a nation
we know that the system itself is is is
created to help them go back to prison
really is so your point senator about I
hope you'll talk about that
taken away to profit doing away with
core profit
let me just pick up on the point that
senator tournament animal open it up I
think this one is a no brainer we have
introduced legislation corporations
should not be profiteering through the
incarceration of fellow Americans and
the discussion from cedar rapids and in
my neighborhood its 50 percent black
it's not for and I agree with everything
people are saying but I still don't
think we're talking about the white
elephant in the room which is over half
of our prison population is there for
nonviolent drug offenses you can't solve
a problem if you continue to throw
people in prison for doing nothing hurts
anybody but themselves and in most cases
doesn't hurt themselves what we have is
gutless politicians who won't stand up
and say we're on Drugs is a complete and
total failure in needs to stop now
questions right
many of you may not get the federal
level at the federal level we have
controlled substance act this is federal
war with rocks right now on schedule 1
you have heroin and alongside her when
you got marijuana that makes sense that
he is introduced legislation that takes
marijuana completely out of the
Controlled Substances Act is a federal
crime
I really like going to the kind you
places like how you do it away you know
you can't get a job we go back to the
same old thing I was talking about the
war on drugs when a police record means
of things he'll want to say a word
proud of being black
there and then all of a sudden I don't
know we're in my mind becomes crack
cocaine and Yes it was my choice you
know but I wasn't warned about you know
when that time it was ok you know so we
tried and that was it and I know people
today who was still underneath that same
illusion from the eighties still chasing
that same fortunately our children they
don't do it because they see how to fix
does but it's still a whole generation
of experience that could have been given
granted to the babies that were behind
us and I'm very angry about the reasons
why I did pick being a drug counselor so
that I can help that type of situation
because honestly we allow some of course
to race IBM black brown white whatever
to color with a record of service to
everybody has something to think about
me
11 years in the penitentiary I changed
my life the fact I change my life I
change over people's I have declined I
do with white black yellow pages of 1765
and if it wasn't for me change my life
being dole's opportunities I was able to
grasp what I couldn't help this so we
hope it helps everybody you helping us
everybody all the questions I spent some
time working with foster care youth aged
16 to 21 it was a mentoring program for
kids
it was a voluntary program so they
didn't they had to have a caseworker but
they didn't have to work with our
program but it was an incentives based
program so if they met goals they could
receive incentives and it was a
government program so we worked at the
Department of Human Services and it was
a really great program and it was pretty
well funded and I felt like we had a lot
of success with the kids that we're
willing to come work with us but the day
they turn 21 they're no longer eligible
for any of those services and percentage
of former foster care youth who end up
homeless at some point in their lives
over half in many states the percentage
of former foster care youth that end up
in prison like where the number of
inmates who are former foster care youth
is over half in most states and I'm just
curious what we can do as a society to
help change our perspective that when
someone is 12 13 14 18 19 20 that they
deserve our support they deserve access
to mental health care services they
deserve
adults who are there as their mentors or
people who have his wide access to
services professional services but
always then when they're 21 they're
supposed to have all their lives
together
they don't have a support network if
they haven't built it through the
professionals that have been working
with them if they don't have it in them
to make it I I don't know what the
answer is but they're still clearly this
funneling of of kids who grew up without
the support that they need it oftentimes
children of people who have been
incarcerated and then end up in the
system sometimes successful system
sometimes unsuccessful system but
regardless whether 21 then it's just cut
off I think through a slot and give it
to the panel as well we have by the way
exactly the same problem for most likely
the same as the society what we have got
to establish be clear about is what our
priorities are is 21 some kind of
magical number so I'm still struggling
when I am 21 trying to do the right
thing right trying to get my feet on the
ground doesn't make any sense in the
world because of the magical number of
points 21 that you pull the rug out from
under those kids and take away the
support system that has kept them alive
and a whole bunch of their lives
frankly I'm gonna tell us which is not
necessarily relevant to your question
but it talks about what we can do what
we want to do it
southern part of my state there was a
principal of a high school this woman
was virtually but not about determining
the kids will not drop out of high
school
hard determination was the kids were not
going to slip through the cracks and
throughout our society that's what
happens billions of times people slip
through the cracks who gives a damn
about that case she gave a damn about
every kid in school she hired mentors
you know what the Mendes da bus kids can
call up that mentor at three o'clock in
the morning if there's a fight between
your parents or bad things are happening
you call up the Metro at three o'clock
in the morning and she or he will be
there for you you are not
going to drop out of school because we
love you and because we're concerned
about your future and she had an
extraordinarily positive result in terms
of keeping people from dropping out of
school
getting jobs but they did it helping
them financially helping them get the
college if that was their goal that's
the bottom line the bottom line is we
now what has to be done they are always
so I come from a family where my dad
came to this country
age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket
he dropped out of school never had much
education my brother graduated high
school that was it I want the college
frankly I was a little bit + hang around
with lawyers kids business people skills
the doctors kids was very insecure about
that this program out there soon return
i'd like you know it the trio program
you know what they do they say to kids
walk 4112 what ten you're not you want
to go to college willing to work with
you within a two year college campus in
a scary thought is anybody else even if
those are the kids up money and your
family does not have an extraordinary
really successful record what's the
bottom line the bottom line is we now in
many cases what has to be done to crush
the news putting the resources into
doing what has to be done
not wanting to punish people wanted to
say hey you're 21 you're out on your own
now good luck you'll hear 75 bucks
you're out of jail you can do it if we
want to make sure that what the kids the
well we know how to do it if we want to
make sure that people who released from
jail do not go back to jail
we know how to do that as well comments
schools and in some way we can connect
the school school should know the
condition of every child in skul they
are the foundation because every child
in this country has to go to school so
there to answer a community safety net
is an answer as well you know age ain't
nothing but a number as as they say it
really is and my son who is a police
officer he just turned 26 he is
independent but he's not because I mama
you know and he's fortunate enough to
have a mother and a father does not go
beyond him all the time even though we
raised him right he had a period of time
especially during the Great Recession
after he graduated with young folks
couldn't
college degrees but he was fortunate
enough to have two parents who can catch
a lot of children don't have that
whether foster children are not absolute
right we have a throwaway mentality in
the society if children don't fit a mold
we throw them away so I believe that the
school system though is the key because
they're the foundation to catch all the
children the ballot box can I just say
that because when we elect people in the
elected ministry who care about the
folks they were elected to serve then we
can have policies back to senator
Sanders point that will do the things
that we need to have done you cannot be
fun programs like that and then expect
these children to be okay you can't be
fined or close down mental health
institutions and think that people are
going to be okay you can't collect
amounts of money off the backs of people
who have fallen on hard times in this
country and think that things are going
to be ok you know I'm a college
professor as well as I know that trio
program very will on the first day of
class I usually ask us to do what they
want to be when they grow up and it
doesn't matter if the 1830 or 65 at
their my class if you are living you
should have a dream in a vision for your
life and I have yet to have one of my
students a to follow US Attorney when I
grow up I want to be poor or when I want
to go to prison that's the life for me
I'm looking forward to this journey
everybody has a dream with somehow along
the way it is snuffed out by Assad's he
debt does not clear if we could just
have some compassion and empathy but
then elect folks senators and to say
give a damn I want to say let people
give a shit Douglas once and not quoting
him exactly but he said something along
these lines that is a better investment
to invest in children in broken mean and
that is what we have to do we can start
right there but the school system
the school system is the best
institutional answer that we had just 1
I'm a proud progressive but any
conservative out there should be
listening to senator Turner promising as
well because the evidence is
overwhelming that when you invest in the
children when you invest in the services
when make sure the kids get a good
education or a good job you save
substantial sums of money
to the University of Iowa is a hell of
alot cheaper that given them up and tell
young lady talk I have my son my son is
running track schools drive and I think
that's very important as a parent
partner again apparently there's a
person who is a role model for
individuals already have been going to
DHS issues now they have and as a parent
point-blank noticed a regardless of what
society says it does most likely most
likely the child
i dont kids one year after two years
after two years after I know young man
has 21 placements and his twenty
one-year-old they cut him off he found
his mom and put me with that jail and
with my son you know the children want
to be with his parents so let's look at
the same with lost a parent a rights
come home and they're in contact with
the force to cure her sin city not a
doctors say they're still in foster care
in this person shows for an adequate
amount of time that they able to
function in our society in the
mannerisms which is appropriate
questions I'm right here I'm actually go
but I go to school
Rapids so I grew up why mexican-american
and so I grew up we don't have cable or
anything
this has a point I promise
and so so I want a lot of like a PBS and
whatnot and so I remember growing up
most of the characters I mean I know
their animals but like most of the
characters I assumed a white and so like
growing up it was kind of hard to
believe myself and so I was wondering if
there's any way that we can make like
public broadcasting television and legal
you require adversity and not just one
character for me traes protagonist of
various races and stuff like that so
that'd be nice I'm gonna give his
campaign but I've been talking about is
my fears that economically we are moving
toward an oligarchic former society
where a small number of very very
wealthy people are receiving today
almost all of the new income in the new
wealth politically I worry that as a
result of citizens united billion as of
buying elections but it also worried
about the media billion raises an issue
1 issue this is what I worry about I
think you can watch television 24 7 and
not get a feeling that what you see is
the reality of american life in many
respects you're talking about race
relations in a sense united people of
your background on television
okay what i'm talking about also and
then return them at this point a moment
ago we just came out of the worst
economic downtown downturn in the modern
history of this country since the Great
Depression millions of people walk their
draws millions of people lost their
homes
millions of people lost their life
savings the day in America you have a
middle class which is disappearing you
have in some cases
people's life expectancy going down
massive despair reflected on television
is the reality of America reflected in
the struggles that people are making
half of the people 55 years of age or
older
up to 65 50 savings for retirement that
at seven years of age you got nothing in
the bank how do you think you feel
you're scared to talk about it NBC ABC
soap operas so much not so much so your
point is right and i agree with you but
it's easy
deeper than that we are a country where
millions of people are in despair black
white
they want to see your reflection of
their realities in media and in many
respects they are not in NA say who the
hell is talking about my life who knows
about my life why should I vote nobody
cares about nobody even knows what's
going on in my life so media becomes a
very important part of the reality of
American I think we need some big
changes that anyone want to do that
part of how things are
how we're losing control as a country is
that we are at each others throats I
think that there's a lot of different
brands that we tend to fall under the
Sooners talking about pretty much in
what is pretty much effect is more than
anything else in my belief is classes
are being one another for one reason or
another so that we cannot come together
and figure out what needs to be done
while those who are supposedly sitting
above economic coup culpability looking
and plotting how can we keep them
confuse so we can keep making
however I also know that those issues my
royalty passed the Senate see that might
just be a first talked about that
worry about that wow they were they
maybe I still plotting and planning to
confuse from just very profound point
just pick up on it
want you to hear this in america today
the top one tenth of one percent not 1%
1.1% owns almost as much wealth as the
bottom 90% wealthiest 20 people in this
country 12 to 20 people on more wealth
than the bottom 50% of the american
people hundred and fifty million people
58 percent of all new income generated
today
58% is going to the top 1% you seen on
tv likely not too much and what's wrong
I rather have us fighting against each
other and black and brown and white gay
and straight you're born in Mexico
you're born in America
well with mexico but let's talk about
that let's not talk about how we come
together to create an economy that works
well rather than the top one percent
everybody who are real American heroes
are about I cannot begin to imagine the
kind of strength that was required to
transform their lives and to make the
point that what they want to do with
their lives and what makes them stronger
human beings is actually help other
people I want to thank them very much
what they are doing what their
participation in this panel that I want
to thank all of you for coming out for
helping us address one of the major
crises facing this

the

and we are so lucky to have more than
today
to be that noise and beauty here that
was directly Sullivan give you a great
big
what Minnesota well behind them
now we are sold
happy and need his leadership fighting
for economic social and racial just as
we did not continue
limbs data wall we needed couldn't
handle a
the
doomed
doomed
9 a.m. hand heart I would tell everybody

done collapse
and love the mall soul let me also
apologize
we didn't have the Hui -ism
about 10 days ago we said we're going to
be the Northern Iowa home
let's go to Minnesota local cue ball
show all
we as the stor you're going to use the
whole thing flying 200 people
not what the hell were we came here this

or apologizing all apologies that's what
a lot of old
everybody would like very much the
live near your home just tell you about
the client we
that we've had which is pretty crazy on
Tuesday
always thought all informally to go on a
campaign to my hometown
a Burlington Vermont we are over 5,000
people government-held
never want to go ahead sure standing
room only in a bed after bed
after that last couple days when you
know I was just looking for the very
worst lots
handbook and what we're doing here today
and video the
so I think it is a to say it
that we are all to ensure all start-up
in this if you have a name a campaign
which is calling for
a political revolution they're just like
the
now little water 30 and this is what I
mean from the bottom of my heart
and also with everything that I believe
them intellectually
I heard the jams burning burning burning
and I appreciate that
but this is not about burning it really
is about you
and when I just bought a lot of
political revolution what everybody has
got on the slant
is not the only other classes and their
representatives in Washington on
so-called
that the best president in the world
cannot the
level all we need a mass movement of
millions of people with
the
the movement at all anymore stands all
it says loudly and clearly you that this
great nation on the house and our
government
belonged to Albany bowl and not just a
head cold
affiliate the
this country today the
faces more serious problems than at any
time since the Great Depression
and if you throw in if you add to that
the planetary prices %uh climate change
it
the problems today maybe even mall
Syrians and here is my promise to you
for this game today
not only will I quite to protect the
working families in this country
I'm but we all going to build
AP permanent move it in this country in
which we are going to the standoff
and final at and we're going to do that
not necessarily with millions of
30-second TV ads
we got the goal directly to the people
in meetings like that
the
and with your help we're going to be
knocking on doors
all over Minnesota all over america
level
and we're going to be doing our very
best didn't know working
families in this country that they
cannot continue 2000 he more working
night and day
I guess they are all less the
I no longer than I expected
the poet lowly an excellent all
at all over the body is mostly okay a
bottle or a lawyer all does the world
class
the bullet people rodeo
what you think in a way yeah 720
the
hey not solid challenge
massive education massive of catalyzing
headway we say get understanding yes but
we're never going to view on this issue
or that is true nobody is gonna be a
hundred percent
whatever you but we were you working
families together to say
we want our kids to be able to get a
good education
these jobs the shit out of him nobody
will stop on the
let me just very briefly very briefly
give you an overview of some of the
issues
there we are gonna be campaigning on to
my mind I'm
the most significant issue we face
is the world's best level often
commonweal
getting quality in america the
in america today %um we have more
in calm and wealth inequality than any
other major industrialized country on
earth
and it is worse today that any time
since nineteen the 20 know I know
years to overwhelm and income inequality
is the great moral you're still up on
him
it is a great economic gives you all the
time
it is a great political if you all out
of time
and we are gonna do. got into the
and my only aim be very clear about this
let me tell this
to the billionaire lol class that today
has it all
there is something profoundly wall
when the hard-won yeah all along
per se not 100 percent want to help one
percent
also also supports well as a lot of
ninety percent
they are resolving roles loudly wall
when not even be not lying were said
although income generated two-day
goal at the heart one of his own there
is something profoundly wall
when in recent years we have seen a
proliferation
up millionaires and billionaires while
the average American is working
water well as below last year's and we
have the highest rate of childhood
bloody
largo de Majo country on earth
there is something profoundly ruled
wind warning family in this country
almost as much as well as a lot on all
million Americans this
world-class level updating them all and
wealth inequality
is bad economics it is unsustainable
and this is what my upbringing economy
which america is not so but also
totally hot I'll this is not the James
the
Edward what you'll look at all it is
gonna change
because we are going to create an
account a million that works for all
bball and not just a handful of people
on the Tom
the
but it is not just incall and wealth
inequality is more than that
today in America local what we are
seeing is that all will last
quality you years last 40 years
great middle-class of this country
once the head be up to you by a world
has been disappearing the today
despite expanded my knowledge an
explosion
%uh technology and huge increase in
worker productivity
median family income is almost five
thousand dollars less
that it was in ninety 99
in my state overload and I'm short
minutes old
we have many more working not just one
job to job
three jobs trying to cobble together in
a column
and some pellicano that is not what this
economy
it's almost like they allow the
gruza the automobile i'm in in america
is not quite like four or so it's not
the
officials that is like don't you see we
got to go
the paywall if you include those people
who have given up looking for work
and all those people working part-time
real unemployment in america today
is close to 11 presided you got
unemployment is seventy percent
african-american you love like that is
all good thoughts
today jangling
we have applauded by billion people
who are living in poverty and many of
them all working
forty or fifty hours alway
today
today we all live it
in a day should which has more well
then any shouldn't in the history
%uh the world but the problem here
that all will all that well
is going to go ahead well up people home
dots room is that in the last 30 years a
there has been a eulogy redistribution
well a it as a dog with a little
class done a very rich
and what we are saying today is it not
only is the No
we want not well the cod black the
working families
of the
now let me know much alone may not fully
healed
that is a huge consequences for our
country
and let me be as blunt as I can tell you
one
as I can be in the Holy Name you like
many of you already know
and that is as a result of the
disastrous Supreme Court decision
on citizens united the American
political says the has been slowly
corrupted
and the well you should pull American
democracy
got the
what the supreme court house actually
set
to the wealthiest people in this country
the billionaire class
what is it is are you guys already own
mucho you gonna be
now we're going to give you the
opportunity to all
the United States government and state
governments all
this country I'm and that is precisely
what these people on now trying to do
american democracy is not allow home
billionaires being able to live
candidates
and elections it is not about the Koch
brothers
Sheldon Adelson and other incredibly
wealthy individuals
spending billions and billions of
dollars to elect candidates
who will make the rich richer and
everybody else
moral there was recently a media report
which is just that the whole world is
themselves
one of them second wealthiest American
12 family name will spend more money
in this election cycle then I will the
Democratic Party
all the republican party brothers and
sisters
that is not a democracy not cool
paula coughlin the
and when we talk about the major issues
facing our country and in fact
facing the world I'm when we talk about
our responsibility uses human beings
and as it turns a lot got want kids and
seven grandchildren
there is nothing more important then
leaving this country
end this planet in a way that is
inhabitable
for our kids and all branches of the
go home told me is all
the scientific community is virtually
unanimous
climate change Israel climate change is
caused by human activity
climate change is already causing
devastating problems
in our country and around the world
and if we do not get our act together
in years the car the situation will be
substantially world
what the scientists are telling us if we
allow businesses to go on as usual
by the end of this century the planet
/url could be buying to defend it really
is
paradigm wall of more riled
more floods more extreme weather
disturbances
more rising sea levels mauled minnesota
became shouldn't
more diamond more disease more human
suffering
we meeting must not allow got to happen
the
hacksaw mold all the big oil companies
in the Koch brothers a make a lot of
money and possible
you all day one on not to address this
issue 1
but we all understand that is caretakers
all our environment as many people who
enjoy a little Union
all our country and the planet we are
not going to allow them
do the following this blood but their
short term profits
the
know what are the challenges that we
face that it is a huge
time you know I'm
is that the american people want very
disillusioned
with the political muscles they are very
demoralized
in the last midterm elections
sixty-three percent
well people didn't bowl he
resigned young people the lovable
and all over this country people are
hurting
they're worried about their kids they're
worried about their parents
so worried about what happens to the win
the gold and we look to washington and
leasing
be those people they're not dealing with
the realities
my like and they listen to the media on
the television logo lol political gossip
are all kinds the ground and not talking
about the realities facing
ordinary Americans media looking at
politics is a war a baseball game was so
lopsided home
rather than addressing the issues as to
how we transform America what we need to
do in my view
you know the with your home and we have
a website which is
going to get better in bed at school
Bernie Sanders like um we want your
ideas we want your feedback is we'll go
together but
a sexually what we need to do use
creative in the region
very clear Jenn that makes sense to
working families
all over this country as to what I'm the
government should be doing
to transform our country. and improve
lives rolling
what I wanted to know in a few minutes
you would you really luv pretty quickly
young
I want to watch along well I think could
be innocent who will all be progressive
agenda on
and the person who now wield is when you
want to be when you want to be with you
do polls
what people always say when you ask them
what is the most important thing on
their minds
it so you cool little whirlwind gold
jobs
jobs and the reason they say that is the
No
that unemployment is much too long they
worry about the kids being able to get a
decent job
they worry that the usability they're
gonna be delayed a long time
and not be able to get a job that pays
them in half the wages they're currently
burning
so in my view we need the media room
federal jobs program degrees millions
apiece and then jobs the
now
and and a hole-in-one our infrastructure
is crumbling
1l rules out which is all water systems
always what our plans are at once I will
I'll let you use and what they mean
enormous amount to were a little
we ought not to invest happily and
in Wheeling this infrastructural and
when we do let
we make this country moral should what
would dilute
and save money and we can create with
the $1 trillion dollar investment which
I have a proposal up to 30 million
these many Jones the
to
little here is not only a marginal
creating jobs which we have to do it is
a question of saving and preserving jobs
you are looking at a United States I
don't know
who was voted against trade agreements
like nafta the
I voted against nafta you have to
remember the normal trade relations with
China I'm
and I'm gonna help lead his opposition
against the trans-pacific partnership
the
it smoothens that since 2001
in vermont in minnesota ran all over
this country we have lost
almost six the thousand back two reasons
and millions on these and many jobs we
all
who rawlins trade agreements that every
corporation in America and the drug
companies
and will bring wide open and when their
goal
is the greatest situation with a good
shot done in america
and we'll do low-wage countries an hour
job is done lol
that we want trade agreements the
wholesale for american workers
and workers on the board that we want
them to start creating jobs
in america auto not just good other
countries around the world the
and when we leave more lol the economy
when we talk about the economy
let's all hope in Clio that millions of
American workers all working good wages
on
what's not much much bloom lolol
the
welcome our earnings middle mobile
federal minimum wage
%uh seven dollars and twenty five
insights into how well
is a starvation wage we've got a razor
what a living wage the
as some of you may know the city of los
Angeles is a
recently raise the minimum wage there
are 15 bucks an hour over her in a few
years but not exactly but like a
for the we must obligate pay equity
for women workers the
it is in government support there is a
lot acceptable the women doing the same
work as men
make 78 cents on the dollar that's got
to change.
Ste
and we'll talk with whom respect and the
working people of this country in Olin
every worker in america auto
has been a bit sick leave bank guarantee
but he should buy
the
now when we deal with an incall in
wealth inequality what we have to
understand that
is not just another well-used people in
this country and the largest
corporations are doing phenomenally well
what we also have do understand is that
we have
8 axis global with his written by these
very same
we will and it's grossly on them so let
me be very clear
11 000 all the billionaires who watching
that the the
diploma like did the president know it
was not named
your fair share the
we have that you could believe this
we haven't had this is the Loom
which allow those you who demand model
what reasons
the stash their money in the Cayman
Islands Bermuda
lot summer other perhaps aliens
then you know you have any time
somalis long profitable operations
bathes the rule in federal income tax
and we are losing
well over $100 billion dollars every
year
because all this packs loom
Warren beloved one of the richest guy is
in the world
reminds us often that he be more like
billionaire
glaze and the fact that why you real
acts were you which is lower than his
secretary is
lower lip truck drivers and lolol then
knows at a time when the wealthy use the
more like the one with the nominally
well
when we have a massive income and wealth
in a while a team
when we have a huge on merit social
needs do you know who will start with me
they and their children of the
and getting back into campaign finance
reform in this disaster Supreme Court
decision let me just say this I said it
before and I'll say it again
if elected president there will be a
litmus test
for my nominees to the United States
Supreme Court
and that is they will hold your business
tourism
human
with

move you may not know

policy a universal the
and
think it what it will mean not just the
young people who are going to college
no the w-league
about what it means the kids were in the
sixth grade

because they will live if the study law
if they take
their academics seriously they will in
fact be able to make it in the middle
class
they will in fact be able to get the job
that they
have drug not allow I and on top of that
in this legislation
what we also like
is to say that we are going to
substantially low interest rates
on Sudan the
to
let me too much on time one other July
only ranking member world
although the Budget Committee know which
means Leader of the Opposition I want to
tell you something
medial kinda forgot to remove this so I
will mention unsealed
editable I'm when our middle class is
disappearing
I'm at a time when families in
Minneapolis
and in vermont are having a hard line
feeding
the kids at a time when an elderly
people
horseshoes between heating their homes
in the wind you're applying medicine are
getting the food that they need them
had a decline when working class
families cannot afford to send their
kids to college
here's what the republican budget I'm to
ask Congress last month old
it roles $27 billion bball
up health insurance bowling ball
it and steel portable camera it makes
the $400 million dollar-plus model
in medicaid which will happily impact
families
whose parents are in nursing homes and
take away health care for low-income
families along its not a girl not how we
provide health care to wall
the 27 million people will help in terms
the republic in the budget
cause the helm grants by ninety billion
already
10-year period make you get a hotel the
young people who like
college the republican budget what
better time
when the families are having a hotline
feeding their kids
cogs food stamps the WIC program
nutrition programs by billions and
billions
up da Luz
and to head an insult to injury you the
republican budget
won't give a huge tax breaks the heart
lieutenants
all 100 percent one really completely
be a steak times in
now listen baby but my art museum
public coexist and the other will you
know
a who control the Republican Party
dockiers
not our little holiday dollars ought not
our priorities the
and with all the people whom who say
that we're not done got social security
Wow that we've got tonight benefits with
the same old
veterans we say all our
dead bottoms the
goldman's gertrudis
not only should we not be cut in the
Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid
but in terms of social security
specifically you know him I know that
there are a lot of seniors and people
with disabilities I'll
who are trying to get my own twelve
thirteen fourteen thousand dollars a
year old Bailey doing I'm
it's not a lot about according to social
security where the Exped
social security
the
instead of talking about cutting head
start
and child care help we're going to be
talking about universal
a portable pre-k education the
nice things some people out there may
say well you know what bernie is talking
about is kinda expensive and it's kinda
Ronald
but let me tell you really it is not and
when I hold very much
you do not get close to home in the
mindset
dissolve the saloon around the country
today in the mindset is well we have a
deficit
should we cut education like five
billion what twenty billion in the
liberals say only kinda
wifi billion you with role as many
people will help him
well that many will all help help she
would you be this big a tax break into
the global Regents
morally a little bit about the tax break
to the global Regents
we have got to change that Mike said
and I'm sure you'll into well leaders
part 3
did the history %uh the world the
in the world news country in the history
of the world
we have got the the bid and have a
different lujan beloit this country do
any
yeah the
we have see trillions of dollars all
will last
thirty years transit route for working
families and the middle class
upward and that is the premises on who
would you will begin
there's discussion I'm can we afford as
a nation
the reply free tuition ecologist because
we can't
can we have a higher quality excellent
trial has this little
which is a little to working families
%uh because weekend
can we join the rest of the
industrialized world and other national
health care program
guaranteed health care to all about the
mobile uploads weekend
the
you only need to have the highest grade
on trial the bloody
have any major country on earth no we'd
all
the do we need to have a he economic
situated should
when ninety-nine percent in the cup goes
to the top one percent
dole we'll look so what if my holes
is too old for schools really Bernie
Sanders
can't do it alone we have got do we
would get along well
do a school on grassroots movement the
and stuck to the wall we have cock
Lincoln
the non small
we have dogs who in our own minds and
our own hearts
imagine in Asian in a government which
works cool
all lost not a government dominated by a
handful of billionaires
and campaign contributors and well-baby
lobbyists we hand create any
bad America I'll because when we stand
together on
they're all a heckuva lot more of a lost
then
call let's go home carpool during the
me
well

fighting for women's rights what you're
doing to expand and improve our
democracy one of the reasons and let me
be very blunt the baptists one of the
reasons I'm running for President of the
United States is that I worry very much
that both economically and politically
our country is sliding into our daughter
this is not an issue but they're gonna
see discuss much on TV but it is the
reality of what's happening in America
we all know wealthiest country in the
history of the world but as we speak
here and media this morning millions and
millions of families are struggling to
feed their kids we have the highest rate
shamefully of poverty of any major
country on earth and forty percent of
african-american kids are living in
poverty all at the same time
58 percent of all new income is going to
the top one percent and the top one
tenth of one percent bonds almost as
much well as the bottom 90% and as a
nation we are gonna have to ask
ourselves whether it is morally
acceptable whether it is economically
sustainable that's all few have so much
while so many have so little in my view
has got to change and we need an economy
that works for working families
economics it is politics as a result of
the disastrous citizens united Supreme
Court decision millionaires and
billionaires are pouring unlimited sums
of money in true the political process
through super PACs and independent
expenditures in the last election last
november sixty-three percent of the
American people didn't vote eighty
percent of young people didn't vote and
in today
millionaires and billionaires are buying
the election is that what democracy in
this country is supposed to be about I
think not
now the truth is all of you know
republicans win when voter turnout is
low when millions of people turn their
backs on the political process when they
look to washington and they sound
working longer hours for low wages what
are you doing for me when this I don't
have any health insurance what are you
doing for me when I say I can't afford
to send my little baby into decent
quality child care what are you doing
some kind of water so my older kids to
college
what do you do it for me and when people
give up on the political process and dog
vote in large numbers when republican
governors suppress the boat when the
co-processor the billionaire's trying to
buy elections Republicans win and we
look so what do we do what we do is make
it clear that in this country we need a
political revolution
shin
the same old same old way to do it
their establishment economics is going
to do it you want I'll tell you how you
win an election for the white house on
you rally millions of working-class
people were given up on the political
process
young people
political process you bring people
together who are prepared to say loudly
and clearly I love document belongs to
all of us not just a handful of billion
and if we do not do that and if this is
a same old same old type of election and
if millions of working people young
people do not participate
republicans will win and we will lose so
let me tell you I am extremely gratified
in my campaign so far that we have
rallied hundreds of thousands of people
to come out our meetings and events that
we have seven hundred and fifty thousand
individuals who have made campaign
contributions not million dollar
contributions to super PACs but $30
apiece warning that any campaign at this
point in a campaign in American history
we win when people come together when we
reject the division of men vs women are
straight forces gay a black versus white
are people born in this country as
opposed to people born in another
country that is what they wanted to go
when we stand together and we say you
know what
in the wealthiest country in the history
of the world the wealthy years people
and the largest corporations are going
to stop paying their fair share of taxes
we win elections when we say to the
working people in this country we know
you can't make it on eight or nine bucks
and hour and that is why we're going to
raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour
we're going to win the election when we
say two women there is no rational
economic reason that women make 79 cents
on the dollar compared to then we're
gonna pay equity we win an election in
which we say to working families yes
when you're going to work
you are going to have quality child care
and pre-k your little ones
where you win this election when we say
to the unemployed we're gonna rebuild
our crumbling infrastructure and create
millions of decent paying jobs and all
people that we wonder what world the
republicans are live again when they did
not use science and refused to go
forward in helping us combat climate
change
we win this election when we make it
clear that women have fought long and
too hot to lose control over their own
bodies we win this election when we
stand up boldly and say no you're not
gonna or defund Planned Parenthood you
gotta put more money so sisters and
brothers we are at historical moment in
American history the crises that we face
today in many ways are worse than any
time since the great depression of the
nineteen thirties and in my view the
what this election is about is not just
selecting a president Paul fall more
significantly it is about transforming
the United States of America
it is about understanding that there is
something very very wrong where the
united states of america is the only
major country on earth not guarantee
they'd Family and Medical Leave how does
that happen
country on earth does not guarantee paid
sick time or paid vacation time how does
that happen
the only major country on earth that
doesn't guarantee health care to every
man woman and child as a right
is to bringing people together by the
tens of millions not stop and it's tough
to do but if we do that when I just
gonna win this election we are going to
win it by a landslide because what
happens is how many people in your
communities believe as republicans do
that we should cut social security
medicare cut medicaid cut federal aid to
education and then give hundreds of
billions of dollars in tax breaks to the
top two two-tenths of one percent nobody
believes that but Republicans can win
elections because so many people have
given up on the political process and
what this campaign is about is
revitalizing american democracy by
bringing people together to stand up and
fight for the promise of what this great
country and be
a nation in which the middle class grows
not shrinks we can be a nation in which
we do not have the highest rate of
childhood poverty of any major country
and what economic and wealth disparity
we can do that but in order to do that
we're going to have to do something that
is pretty hard
pretty pretty pretty hard
this is what we have to do in the last
many decades everybody in this room
knows because you have been part of the
process we have made significant
progress in becoming a less
discriminatory society and we should be
proud that we should be proud then in
2008 the American people decided to vote
for a candidate based on his program and
his ideas and his character not the
color of his skin
all over this country as a result of
your efforts and those that came before
you women have made extraordinary
progress in breaking down discriminatory
or discriminatory barriers and by the
way we are not going back we're gonna go
close and if we were here ten years ago
and somebody jumped up and said you know
I think the gay marriage will be made
legal in every state in this country
somebody else would have asked them what
they were smoking which raises another
reason we have we have made progress
we've made progress in women's rights in
gay rights in civil rights we still have
a long way to go in all of those areas
but we should be proud of what we have
accomplished but here is where we have
not made progress we have not made
progress in the economic struggle we
have lost ground today men and women in
many cases are working longer hours will
lower wages of the new wealth and income
is going to the people on top so the
essential question in terms of economic
struggle is all we prepared to organize
and to take on the billionaire class
which today has so much economic and
political power that is the person and
if we are not successful in doing that
by prediction to you is that the rich
will continue to get richer while most
everybody else gets 40 my prediction to
you is that the republicans who do not
believe Citizens United went far enough
want to get rid of all campaign finance
regulations will simply be able
through the Koch brothers and others to
give checks of hundreds of millions of
dollars to the candidates of their
choice in other words having candidates
become employees of their corporate
interests that's the future if we do not
educate and if we do not organized but I
have confidence that we can do but I
have confidence that we have we come
forward with a progressive strong agenda
that he is prepared to stand up to
corporate america is prepared to stand
up to the Koch brothers and the
billionaire class that is prepared to
outline an agenda which will improve the
lives of tens of millions of our people
we can not only win the White House
regain the senate and the house gain
governors trails all over america not
only can we do that but much more
importantly we can't transfer law in
this country and make it the country we
all know that it can become thank you
all very much

by fall the higher prices in the world
for prescription drugs
now
losing their jobs
school
roads bridges water has a total disaster
but we can create thirty million jobs by
rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure
to succeed we need to be educated
school

Brothers and sisters!
My name is John Nichols,
and I stand before you as a proud Wisconsin progressive.
I am here in the tradition of Robert M. Lafollette.
The Capital Times Newspaper, the Progressive Magazine, the Wisconsin Idea.
And the Wisconsin Uprising of 2011.
I am here to welcome you and I am here to welcome one of you.
Because Bernie Sanders is not separate from the people in this room.
I'm not here to make any endorsements or deliver any grand statements about what you should do in 2016.
That's not... That's not what the Wisconsin progressive movement was ever about.
The Wisconsin progressive movement was about citizens,
gathering in church halls, and schools, and union halls
and deciding the issues that mattered for them!
This has always been a people's movement.
And when leaders arrive the come from the people, they don't dictate to the people.
I'm serious when I say I'm not here to tell you what to do,
 you don't need someone to come up and tell you what to do,
 you don't need someone to come up and tell you what to think about the presidential race,
Senator Bernie Sanders will be here in a moment to make his case.
This campaign is all over this room, they've given you all sorts of information,
they want you to go to berniesanders.com,
they want you to text 82623, pull your phone out and do all that,
and type in Bernie and you' get updates all the time,
 they'll tell you all the bells and whistles.
I'm not here to do any of that.
I am here to tell you what you have already done.
Because what you have already done is more important
than any thing that any candidate will do.
What you have already done
is demand that the 2016 presidential race
have a progressive voice at the table.
And you... You demanded that it be someone who came from you, someone who you knew.
You demanded, that it be someone who has marched with you, someone who has rallied with you,
someone who knows Ed Garvey, and who has campaigned with Ed Garvey,
ladies and gentlemen,
the man who rebuilt the progressive movement in this state,
(?) the father of fighting Bob Fess: Ed Garvey, right here, up front.
Right in front of him, to rows up, the mayor of Madison Paul Soglin right here with us tonight.
Couple steps away from him,
State Senator Fred Risser the longest-serving legislator in the United States.
State Representatives Terese Berceau, and... And Melissa Sargent and a dozen others I can't even pick out here.
It's a remarkable thing that's going on and I want you to know
that a year ago, when Bernie Sanders said to me that he was thinking of running for president of the United States
I had my doubts.
But... But then... But then Bernie Sanders said you know wha... 'cause
he was pretty sure it was going to work because he said he wasn't going to do it like other people did it.
He was going to do it as a movement.
Bernie Sanders didn't make anything.
Bernie Sanders is the product of movements that have made everything.
People demanded a candidate who would stand up absolutely and apologetically for organized labor.
People demanded a candidate who would stand up absolutely and apologetically for fair trade,
not the broken free trade model of NAFTA and the TPP.
People demanded a candidate who would vote against wars and against the PATRIOT ACT.
People demanded a candidate...
People demanded a candidate who would march with Naomi Klein and Bill McKibben
to say "climate change is the essential issue of our time".
And people demanded...
Demanded that finally, a hundred years on,
we would get another candidate who would say as boldly, as Robert M. Lafollette did,
that this fight is not about parties and partisanship and ideology.
This fight is about all of us against a handful of plutocrats that would take everything we have.
Brothers and sisters!
Wisconsin progressives,
You demanded a candidate who spoke your language.
And ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters, please welcome Senator Bernie Sanders!
Whoa!
In case you haven't noticed there are a lot of people here.
 Well, let me...
 Let me begin by thanking John for that very generous introduction.
We love you Bernie!
And let me thank my dear friends: Ed and Betty Garvey,
for all the work they've done for Wisconsin and this country for so many years.
But mostly...
On this early summer night let me thank all of you for being here this evening.
Now, tonight...
Tonight we have made a little bit of history.
You may know that there are some... 25 candidates running for president of the United States
But tonight... We have more people
At a meeting for a candidate for president of the United States
that any other has had in 2016.
Thank you!
Bernie! Bernie!
Now...
It is...
Now, I was show something yesterday, apparently the Wisconsin Republican Party has welcomed me into the state
with a billboard
And... The billboard indicated that I was an extremist.
So let me just say a few words to my friends in the Republican Party about extremism.
When you deny the right of workers to come together in collective bargaining: that's extremism!
When you tell a woman that she cannot control her own body: that's extremism!
When you think a woman is a child and can't purchase a contraceptive: that is extremism!
When you give tax breaks to billionaires and refuse to raise the minimum wage: that's extremism.
But our views, which represent, in fact, the vast majority of the American people, are a little bit different.
We believe....
That the time has come, when people in Wisconsin, Vermont and all over this country create a political movement
which say to the billionaire class: "You can't have it all!".
And what we are saying to the Koch brothers, Governor Walker and all those people,
is that this great country and our government
belong to all of the people and not just a handful of very wealthy people.
Now the truth of the matters is, is that politics in a democratic society should not be complicated.
What politics should simply be about
is people coming together
taking a hard look at the problems that we face
listen to different ideas and then go about solving those problems.
Despite what the media may think politics is not a baseball game with polls,
politics is not a soap opera,
what politics is about in a democratic society is people coming together
and improving life for our people.
And today I want to touch on some of the major issues that are facing our people
and talk to you about some ideas as to how we can address those problems.
But the first point I want to make,
and John Nichols has already made it,
and let me be very clear about this:
this campaign is not about Bernie Sanders,
it is not about Hillary Clinton,
it is not about anybody else,
It is about putting together
a grassroots movement
of millions and millions of people,
who stand together
and make it clear that we need fundamental changes in the economics
 and politics of this country, so the government works for all of us,
and not a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
And let me also tell you:
that in order to win this election, it goes without saying,
that we need a strong grassroots movement,
an unprecedented grassroots movement,
but let me say this to you also,
and this is something that no other candidate will tell you:
and that is that nobody in the White House, no matter how good he or she may be,
can address the major issues facing the working families and the middle class
without an act of politically conscious grassroots movement.
And the reason for that...
The reason for that is not complicated.
It is that the big money interests,
Wall Street, corporate America,
all of these guys have so much power
that no president can defeat them, unless
there is an organized grassroots movement making them an offer they can't refuse.
And that is what this campaign is about.
What this campaign is about is creating a political revolution in America.
A revolution which takes on
the greed of Wall Street and corporate America,
a revolution which takes on the reality
that the Republican Party is, essentially, owned
by big money interests and too many democrats are owned by big money interests.
Today, we live, hard to believe, many people don't sense it,
we live in the wealthiest nation in the history of the World.
That's where we are today.
But most people in this country don't sense that,
don't feel that because all of the wealth
is being held in the hands of a very few.
America today
has more income and wealth inequality
than any other major country on Earth,
and the gap between the very, very rich and everyone else
is wider in America today than it has been since 1928.
The issue of wealth and income inequality, to my mind,
is the great moral issue of our time,
it is the great economic issue of our time
and it is the great political issue of our time.
Let me be as clear as I can be:
there is something profoundly wrong
when, today, the top one-tenth of one percent (0.1%),
own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%.
There is something profoundly wrong when, today,
58% of all new income is going to the top 1%.
There is something profoundly wrong
when, in recent years, we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires
at the same exact time,
as millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages
and we have, by far, the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major industrialized country.
There is something profoundly wrong
when one family, the Walton family of Walmart,
owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans.
This grotesque level of inequality is immoral,
it is bad economics,
it is unsustainable
and it is not what the United States of America is supposed to be about.
This is a rigged economy, and, brothers and sisters, together we are going to change that.
This campaign is sending a message loud and clear
to the billionaire class and that is:
you can't get tax breaks when children in America go hungry.
You cannot continue to send our jobs to China
when millions of Americans
are desperately looking for work.
You can't hide your profits
in Cayman Islands and in other tax havens
while we have so many unmet needs in America.
You're gonna have to start paying.
The greed...
The greed of corporate America and the billionaire class
has got to end, and we are gonna end it for them.
But the issue of our economy is not just
income and wealth inequality.
The issue of what's going on in our economy deals with the tragic reality
that for the last 40 years
40 years the great middle class of America, once the envy of the entire World, has been disappearing.
Despite exploding technology
so that every worker is significantly more productive
then those who came before,
median family income is almost $5000 less today than it was in 1999.
In my state of Vermont, and I am sure that it is true here, in Wisconsin,
we have workers not working at 1 job,
not working at 2 jobs,
but sometimes at 3 or 4 jobs,
at abysmally low wages in order to cobble together an income and some health care;
that is not the American economy that we will accept.
And when you look at the economy what you have to understand is that every month the government announces
a statistic about official unemployment, currently it is about
5.4%.
But,
if you look at another government statistic
which includes those people, who have given up looking for work,
and those people, those millions of people,
who are working part-time when they want to work full-time,
real unemployment today is close to 11% - that is unacceptable.
And let me touch on an issue
that is widely ignored, almost nobody talks about it.
And that while real unemployment
is close to 11%, youth unemployment has reached tragic proportions.
Today in America, for those young people 17 to 20,
those kids who have graduated high school or have dropped out of high school,
if they are white - youth unemployment is 33%.
If they are Hispanic - youth unemployment is 36%.
If they are African-American - youth unemployment is 51%.
In my view, maybe, just maybe,
it makes sense
to create jobs and educational opportunities
for these young people.
Maybe we should create jobs and educational opportunities for the people, rather than
more and more incarceration and more and more jails.
Today in America,
today in America, shamefully,
we have more people in jail
than any other country on Earth.
So our job, in fact,
is to create a new criminal justice system.
Our job is police department reform.
Our job is to make sure the young African-Americans
can walk down the street without being abused or worse.
Our job...
Our job is to have the best-educated
population in the World, not the country with the most people in jail.
And when we talk about the economy, it's not only
the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality, it's not only
the unacceptably high levels of unemployment,
when we talk the economy today we have to understand that tens of millions
of Americans are working in wages which are totally inadequate.
And I know that Governor Walker may disagree.
But to my mind, the federal minimum wage
of $7.25 an hour
is a starvation wage which must be raised.
The minimum wage must become
a living wage, which means
$15 an hour, over the next few years.
Now, I don't think it is a terribly radical idea
to say that in America if someone works 40 hours a week
that that person should not be living in poverty.
And, brothers and sisters, a living wage
should not only be fair, it should be equitable, there is no excuse for women
making 78 cents on the dollar compared to men.
And let me congratulate President Obama
for doing something that is long overdue
and making sure that millions of working people
finally get time and a half when they're working 50 or 60 hours a week.
That's an issue that many of us have been working on and I'm glad the President came through.
Now...
As some of you may know,
many of our republican friends are very deeply concerned about family values, they just
they love families.
And their view of family values
is that women
should not be able to control their own bodies,
their view of family values
is that women should not be able to purchase the contraceptives they need,
you know, when I say these things, it really is hard to believe.
Can you imagine?
And their view of family values
is that gay people should not be able to get married.
Now that is their view, their warped view, of family values.
Let me give you another view
of family values, I have
4 kids, I got 7 beautiful grandchildren, my wife is hear, we've been married for 27 years.
I believe and you believe
in the importance of family.
And that is why,
because we believe in real family values,
the United States must end the international embarrassment
of being the only major country on Earth
that does not guarantee workers paid medical and family leave.
That does not guarantee workers paid sick time or paid vacation time.
So let me talk a little bit
about family values, today in Wisconsin or in Vermont
a woman is having a baby, one of the
most meaningful and important moments in her life, father standing right beside her.
But, because that family does not have a lot of money,
that woman will forced to go back to work
in a week of 7 or 8 days.
That is not a family value.
In every other major country
women, regardless of their incomes,
and the father as well, are able to stay home
with their baby, get to know their baby,
in the most important moments of their baby's life.
That is a family value and that is why I will fight for 12 weeks
of paid family and medical leave.
Let me touch on another issue that is almost never talked about at all,
but it is an issue of enormous consequence.
And that is as the result of the collapse
of the American middle class
what we are seeing is people in our country
working incredibly long hours.
Incredibly long.
I go around the country and I look in the eyes of people
they are tired, they're exhausted, they're stressed out,
because they are working, and working, and working. I'll tell you a brief story.
Couple of years ago, outside a grocery store in Burlington, Vermont, I met a woman.
And she came up to me, she said: "You know, Bernie, my husband and I have one kid.
but we would like to have more kids, but I'm working 3 jobs,
he's working 2 jobs, and we do not believe that we can be the parents
we should be, so we're putting off having more kids."
That story is being told all over America.
Today, the American people are working longer hours
than the people of any other major country on Earth.
The Japanese are very hard-working people
we work 137 hours a year more
than the Japanese.
We work 260 more hours a year than the British.
And we work almost 500 hours a year more
than our good friends in France.
What can we say about the French?
Now here's the point, and I want, I say this
in order to put where we are today in a broader context.
When we were kids in school and we read history textbooks,
we saw pictures in those books
of workers out on the streets, demonstrating
100 years ago, 1910, 1912, 1914,
those workers held up these big banners, and the signs, and you know what those signs said?
They said: "We want a 40 hour work week!".
What they said is...
What they said, is "We are not beasts of burden,
we want time with our families, we want time
for education, we need time for leisure.".
That was 100 years ago.
Today, unbelievably,
85%
of working men
and 66% of working women
work more than 40 hours a week.
100 years have come and gone, and we have lost ground.
Now, at the very least,
what the United States must do, and I will do as president,
is to make sure that every family in this country gets at least 2 weeks off of paid vacation.
Now, when pollsters go out, and they ask American people
what is uppermost on their mind, what are they most worried about, the answer always is:
a four-letter word called "jobs", J-O-B-S.
When you have real unemployment of 11%,
youth unemployment over 30%, now is the time
for a federal jobs program to create millions of decent-paying jobs.
In virtually every state in this country our infrastructure,
our roads, our bridges, water systems, waste water plants,
our rail system, our levies and out dams
need an enormous amount of work.
Now is the time to invest in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure,
a one tril...
A one trillion-dollar investment
will create and maintain some 13 million jobs,
and that is exactly what I intend to do.
But when we talk about jobs,
it's not just the need to create millions
of decent-paying jobs,
it is the necessity to end job loss as a result of disastrous trade policies.
You are looking at a Senator and former Congressman
who voted against NAFTA, against CAFTA, against permanent normal trade relations,
and I will do everything that I can to defeat this disastrous TPP.
And when we talk
about rebuilding the American middle class
we're talking about rebuilding the American trade union movement.
There are millions of workers who would like to join
unions today, but are unable to do so,
because of illegal actions on the part of their employers.
In my view,
if 50% + 1 of workers in a bargaining unit
sign a card asking for a union - they should have that union.
And when we talk
about greed, when we talk about recklessness,
when we talk about illegal behavior,
these are just another word, another phrase, to describe Wall Street.
In my view, and this a hugely important issue,
for the future of our economy it is time to break up
the largest financial institutions in this country.
Wall Street continue to be
an island unto itself
gambling trillions
in risky financial instruments
while expecting the public to bail it out.
In my view, and we've introduced legislation to deal with this,
if a bank is too big to fail - it is too big to exist.
When we talk
about issue of jobs or
education or the environment
or any other significant issue,
they all are related to
another issue
which undermines everything else that's going on in America.
And I think you in Wisconsin are very familiar with this issue.
So let me be as blunt as I can be
when I tell you what you already know.
And that is, that as a result of the disastrous Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case
the American political system
has been totally corrupted,
and the foundations of American democracy are being undermined.
What the Supreme Court said in so many words, is they said to the wealthiest people in this country,
they said: "OK guys, you already own much of the economy,
now we are going to give you the opportunity
to own the United States government."
and that is what they are trying to do right now.
Let me be as clear as I can be.
And that is, that as President of the United States I will not nominate any
justice to the Supreme Court, who has not made it crystal-clear
that he or she will vote and work to overturn this disastrous Citizens United decision.
Long-term, overturning Citizens United is terribly important, passing a disclosure law is terribly important, but, long-term,
if we want to see a vibrant democracy,
where people of any political point of view who want to be in public service
can get up and run for office
without having to beg rich people for money, we need to move to public funding of elections.
Let me give you an example... Give you an example of how bad
the situation is today. According to media reports, which, I think, are accurate, the Koch brothers alone,
second-wealthiest family in America,
a family that wants to eliminate
social security, medicare, medicaid,
public education,
and virtually every piece of legislation passed since the 1930s which protect the working families, this one family
will be spending, in this election cycle, close to $1,000,000,000.
And they're job, and what they're money is about, is to elect candidate who make the rich richer and everybody else poorer.
But when you have 1 family spending close to a billion dollars, which is more money
than either the Democratic Party or the Republican Party will spend,
this is not democracy, this is oligarchy, and we have got to end it.
And let me also be clear, that American democracy means one person - one vote.
American democracy means that we try to have the highest voter turnout in the World.
American democracy does not mean voter suppression or the gerrymandering of districts.
I think everybody here knows that we are living in a very competitive global economy.
And that if we are gonna succeed, if our economy is going to do well in years to come
we need to have the best-educated workforce in the World.
To my mind, it is basically insane, and I use that word advisably,
and counter-productive to the future of this country, when we have today hundreds of thousands
of bright, young, qualified people, who want to get a higher education,
they want to go to college, but they are locked out because their families don't have enough money.
And that is not only pulling the ladder out from under these young people who want to work hard and make it to the middle class,
it is not the way you create a growing and vibrant economy when we need doctors, and scientists, and nurses, and teachers and all kinds of educated workers.
But the issue goes beyond the high cost of college and people not being able to get in to college.
Today, we have a situation where we have millions of young and not-so-young people
who are shouldering horrendous college debt decade after decade.
A year or so ago I met with some folks, and there was a young women there
whose dream it had been to go to medical school and practice primary care for lower-income people, exactly the kind of physicians that we need, and that's what she did.
And as a result, she left school $300,000 in debt.
For the crime of going to medical school so she can work with low-income people. Then, I thought that that was
really quite extreme, and then I was in Iowa, a couple of months ago,
and I mention this fact, and a young woman came up to me after my remarks, and she said: "Senator, I just graduated dental school $400,000 in debt.".
Now, that is why, and all over this country young people fifty, sixty thousand dollars in debt
talk to somebody recently spending 20% of her income paying back student debt. People can't get married, they can't get have kids, can't buy a house because of the student debt.
So, we've introduced legislation, which I will push through as president, that does two things:
Number one, it will make every public college and university in America tuition-free.
And, I want you to know, the importance of that concept is not just
for kids in the 11th or 12th grade who want to go to college,
the importance of that concept, is that it will resonate with kids in the 5th grade and in the 6th grade right now, all over America,
there are young kids, who may not know it intellectually, but they know it emotionally, their parents didn't go to college,
the kids in their neighborhood don't go to college, why should they study hard? Why should they do their homework if they're not going be able to get a higher education or get into the middle class? That's wrong!
So we are saying to every kid in America: "If you study hard, if you do your work,
you will, in fact, be able to get all the education you need, regardless of the income of your family.".
And when we talk about student debt it is absolutely unconscionable that we have folks today, who are paying interests rate of 8%, 9%, 10%
on student debt, which they are stuck with for decades, yet they can go out and refinance their home for 2% or 3%.
So what we've got to do, is allow people with student debt to refinance
we've got to get the government out of the business of profiteering off of student debt as well.
And when we do that, we can cut student interest rates by more than half.
Now, when we talk, when we talk about the major issues facing not only our country, but the World,
it is absolutely essential that we talk about our responsibilities as human beings,
as adults, as parents, and understand, that there is nothing more important than leaving this planet in a way that is habitable for our kids and our grandchildren.
The debate is over. The scientific community has spoken in a virtually unanimous voice,
climate change is real, climate change is caused by human activity,
and it is already causing devastating problems all over our country and all over the World.
You don't have to look further than the water situation in California,
you don't have to look further than what's going on in Pakistan, where people are dying from an unprecedented heat wave.
The scientists are telling us, loudly and clearly, that if we do not boldly transform our energy system
away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy,
this planet will see a temperature rise of between 5 and 10 degrees
centigrade, with extraordinary negative consequences.
What that means, is more drought, more floods, more extreme weather disturbances,
more acidification of the ocean, more rising sea levels.
And what the CIA and the Department of Defense tell us, is that when people around the World don't have food,
because the land that they are working on is no longer arable,
when they do not have enough water, this causes international
security issues, where people fight each other for limited natural resources.
As a nation, we can,
as a nation, we must,
lead the entire World in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel.
And let me just... Let me just...
Mention something to you that many of you know know, and that is
today, sadly, tragically, the United States of America is the only major, industrialized nation
that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right.
That is not something that we should be proud of, it is something we should be embarrassed about.
Despite the gains of the Affordable Care Act
35 million Americans continue to lack health insurance
and many more are under-insured with high deductibles and high co-payments.
Yet, despite all of that,
we continue to spend almost twice as much per capita on health care
as do the people of any other nation. In my view,
this country must make two fundamental decisions with regard to health care.
Number one, in America health care must be a right for all of our people.
And number two, if we are going to provide health care,
to all of our people in a cost-effective way, if we're going to take
the burden off the backs of small businesses,
we need to move to a medicare for all single-payer system.
All of you who are here this evening, I think, have an understanding,
about how real change takes place in our country, and has historically taken place.
You are aware that change takes place from the bottom on up.
It's never from the top on down, people on top are usually the last to know.
You are all aware, that a hundred and more years ago, workers, who were working incredibly long hours under horrendous working conditions,
said "Enough is enough, we're going to form unions and engage in collective bargaining.".
And as a result of those efforts we have created a middle class
in this country workers had decent wages, decent benefits.
And politically, because of millions of workers coming together, we passed social security, medicare, and medicaid, and many other programs to help the American people.
Because people came together. All of you are aware of the tragic history of racism in America.
But for a very long time, African-Americans and their white allies
came together, and they struggled, and they stood up for justice.
And they stood up to lynching, and they stood up to segregation, and they stood up to a situation that African-Americans couldn't even vote in America.
And change came about, not as much as we would want,
we know that we still have racism in America, but, as a nation, we should be proud of the fact
that in 2008 we elected the first African-American to be the president of the United States. Most of all things.
So many people stood up for civil rights, didn't happen because of a few,
and when we talk about women's rights, we know that women, the suffragettes,
Susan B. Anthony and all those folks went to jail,
some of the died, and they said: "Women in America and around the World will not be second-class citizens!".
And that struggle continues to exist today.
And then, in more recent history, we have seen gay people saying: "We will not be discriminated against any more.".
And a huge change swept the country, huge change in consciousness, and said that we are going to treat all of our people
with respect and dignity, no matter what their sexual orientation may be.
And last week, a very conservative Supreme Court, finally made gay marriage legal in 50 states.
So, as a nation, we have a right to be very proud
of the successes that we have seen because of the struggles of millions of people to create a less discriminatory society.
That's something we should be proud of.
Right, we deserve a hand for that.
But there is one struggle
in which, not only have we not succeeded,
but in which we are losing ground, and that is the fundamental struggle for economic justice.
I am in the Senate the ranking member of the budget committee.
Which means that I am the democratic leader on that committee, and I want to give you an example,
and I want to speak now not just to the people in this room, but to working class and middle class republicans in the state of Wisconsin,
because I want you to know what  many people do not know, I want you know what your party, the Republican Party, is doing
in Washington D.C.. This is what the republican budget did,
and I know something about it, because I am the ranking member of this committee, this is what it did:
2 months ago, this legislation was passed.
And this legislation sets the framework for what the appropriations committees will do later on.
35 million Americans have no health insurance, only country, major country on Earth without health care for all,
republicans decided to end the Affordable Care Act,
cut medicaid by over 400 billion dollars,
throw 27 million Americans off of health insurance.
At a time when the middle class is struggling
to send their kids to college, republican budget over a 10-year period cut 90 billion dollars from the Pell Grant Program.
At a time when millions of Americans are working 40 or 50 hours a week
and are not earning the income they need to adequately feed their family
the republicans made massive cuts in nutrition programs
for hungry people and for children, including the Wick Program,
which is designed to protect low-income pregnant women and their newborn babies.
And then, after making massive cuts in health care, education, nutrition, and many, many other programs that working families depend upon
the republicans decided to give over 200 billion dollars of tax breaks to the top two-tenths of 1%.
In my view... In my view, when we
reach out, and what this campaign is about is to reach out to working families all over this country,
including republicans, because I believe, I believe,
I believe that the Koch brothers and the republican leadership in Washington has gotten away with murder for too many years.
What they have done, is try to divide our country up
black vs white, native vs immigrant, gay vs straight,
and what they have done is try to divide us, our job is to bring people together
around a progressive agenda that works for all of us.
Go out, please, where we need,
where we need most help, not just in winning this election, but in transforming America,
is to create a process by which people stop voting against their own best interest.
Ask your republican friends at work if they really think it makes sense
to vote for people who are going to send their jobs abroad.
Vote for people who will not raise the minimum wage. Vote for people who will take health care away from their own children.
And when we are successful in bringing our people, the middle class working people together,
we will transform America.
Let me conclude
by saying this: if anything
what I would like to ask of you is: think big, not small.
In Washington the debate is often about whether we cut education by 2% or 6%.
Whether we throw this many people or that many.
Whether we give corporations this much of a tax break or that much of a tax break. That's not the World view we should have.
Our vision should be, that in the wealthiest country in the history of the World there is nothing that we cannot accomplish.
We can! We can provide health care to every man, woman and child as a right.
We can make certain that every person in this country can get all of the education he or she needs regardless of the income.
We can create millions of decent-paying jobs, we can have the best childcare system in the World.
In the last 30 years
there has been a huge redistribution of wealth
from the middle class and the working families to the top 0.1%.
Our job is to reverse that, redistribute wealth back into the hands of working families.
Now, in terms of this campaign,
I am more than aware,
that my opponents will be able to outspend us, they have
billionaire backers, they have Super PACs, they've a lot of millionaire friends.
But we are gonna win this election, be-
We are gonna win this election, because if we do our job well,
if we develop the grassroots national movement that I know we can,
at the end of the day, they may have the money, but we have the people,
and when the people stand together - we can win! Thank you all very much!

the
thank you
thank you
the
thank you
you know we have heard we have had
large turnouts in Wisconsin
in Colorado this is the largest turnout
the
are the
the
there are a lot of people here
you know when we were coming to Arizona
somebody said Arizona
is a conservator stay what they talkin
somebody told me that people are given
up
on the political process not what I see
a
tonight the
thank you all so much
I cannot believe this crowd I just one
of thank you so much
the company
of the president's you are incredible
practices here
tonight gives me hope and gives people
all over this country hope
that when we stand together when we come
together
in meetings like this there is nothing
that we cannot
accomplish a transforming America the
and i wanna thank you land of for that
wonderful introduction
she's a member of the CW a and I thank
the CW way
have a trade union movement this country
what this campaign
is about is pretty simple what this
campaign is about
is saying that our great country
an hour government belong to all the
people
and not a handful billionaires the
well i wont to do tonight is to do
something that we
to rally to and that is just lay on the
table
the important issues facing our country
and determine how we can go forward
so that government represents all of us
and addresses the serious problems that
we face
and the first issue the first issue
well i wont to put on the table
is the issue of income
and wealth inequality the
today
we live in eighty nation
which has more income and more wealth
any quality than any other major country
on earth
that is not acceptable it's a gap of we
are gonna change not
the
if you think about it for a moment
you recognize that the issue
loving Commonwealth inequality is a
moral issue
all we could sense
the perry did finish the sentence
all week concerns to seeing a
proliferation
%uh millionaires and billionaires what
we have the highest rate of childhood
poverty
have any major country on earth
it is a moral issue but it is an
economic issue as well because
our economy can not do well
when so few have so much and so many
have so little the
my Republican friends think that the
CEOs of large corporations
on the job creators you know
do you know who the job creators of you
are the job creators
the
and when working people have money in
their pocket
they go out and they buy goods today by
services
and when they do that they create jobs
but when millions of people
have nothing to spend we are not
creating
the jobs that we need
and that is why I believe that what our
economics should be about is putting
money
it to the hands of working people and
not
the billionaires the
brothers and sisters there is something
profoundly wrong when the top
one to ban of 1 percent own
almost as much wealth as the bottom
ninety percent
there is something profoundly wrong
when in the last several years
fifty-eight percent
all new income created has gone
to the top one percent
there is something profoundly wrong
when one family one family the owners a
Walmart
own more well on the bottom
40 percent up the American people
this grotesque level of income and
wealth
any quality is bad economics
it is unsustainable and it is not what
the United States of America
is supposed to be about the
and we have a message tonight
to the billionaire class
and that message is you cannot
how did all the
you cannot cure huge tax breaks
where children in Vermont then Arizona
go hungry
you cannot could continue to to ship our
jobs to China
when millions of Americans need work
here
the
you cannot hide
your profits your billions in profits in
the Cayman Islands
and other tax havens when we have on
Matt needs that america
that box be address the
and what we are saying to the
billionaire class
is they agree has got tired
and we are gonna dead followed up the
what it is not charged
the grotesque an embarrassing love
11.com
and wealth inequality when we talk about
what's going on in america today
we have gone to recognize the tragic
reality
that for the last 40 yeah it's not ten
years
not twenty book for the last forty years
the great middle-class
of this country once the envy of the
entire world
that middle-class has been disappearing
and I want you to think about this all
love you know now we have seen in recent
years an explosion
up technology and work of productivity
and yet despite that median family
income today
is almost five thousand dollars lasts
that it was in 1999
all over america all over America all
over our great country
people are working not just one job not
just two jobs they're working three jobs
for jobs to cobble together some income
and some health care this economy can do
and much too better than that
let me say a word
about on employment once a month you
read the official unemployment
results coming from
the government and they tell you that
official unemployment is 5.3 percent
but what they don't tell you is if you
look at another government statistic
which includes those people have given
of looking for work
and those people who are working
part-time you know everybody working
part-time
when I want to work full time when UN
although back together real unemployment
is 10 .5 per side and let me tell you
something apps
that we all most noble the scars
and that is the tragedy abused
unemployment in this country
a recent study came out recent study
came out
looking at kids who graduated high
school
and this is what it said if those kids
were whites their real unemployment rate
was thirty
3 percent if they were Hispanic
their unemployment rate was thirty
six-percent
if they were african-american their
unemployment rate was 51 per side
and let me tell you something else in
america today
we have more people in jail than any
other country on earth
that's right
and one of the reasons aside from
a broken criminal justice system
one of the reasons that we have so many
people
in jail is that we have five and a half
million kids
hanging out on street corners with no
jobs
and no education
and it seems to me to make
a lot more sense to invest
in education and jobs for our kids
rather go to jail
credit card for richer the
i wont our country to have the best
educated
people more people going to college than
any other country
not more people jail than any other
country
the
and when we talk about the economy it's
not just income and wealth inequality
it's not just high unemployment is low
low wages all over our country in my
state in your state you got people work
in 40-50 hours a week
not earning the money they need to feed
their families
or put a few books in the back in
washington the federal minimum wage
is seven dollars and twenty five cents
an hour
brothers and sisters 725
is a starvation wage
we have got to talk we have got to raise
the minimum wage
to a living wage 50 bucks an hour
the
I don't think it is a radical idea to
say
there is somebody works 40 hours a week
that person should not be living in
poverty
that's what america should be
and when we talk about fair wages
we also have to understand that it is
unacceptable that women today
make 78 cents on the dollar compared to
the
brothers we have got to stand with our
system is
and fight for pay equity for women
workers
now is
many of you know a lot of my republican
colleagues
you know what they stand for well let me
tell you what they stand for
summer what these what
are republican colleagues talk about
of family values are real talk about
family values
and this is what damian
by family values they mean that a woman
should not be able and have the right
to control her own body I get some great
day believe that women
if you can believe this should not be
able to purchase
the contraceptives they wont
and they believe that our gay brothers
and sisters
should not have the right to marry
those Aug now family values
goes on not our family values
but let me tell you well I think
family values should be real family
values
that support families that enable
love to exist can to exist in families
first we have doctor ends the
international embarrassment
up the United States being the only
major country on earth which does not
guarantee
workers paid medical and family leave
today in Arizona
today in vermont a woman
is giving birth if that woman has
ample income she will be able to stay
home
and the father will be able to stay home
with that baby
to get to bond with their baby to get
the love that baby to get to know that
baby
in perhaps one of the most important
moments
in a family's like but if that woman
does not have adequate income she will
be forced to go back to work
in three days five days seven days
is not a family value that is
that is exactly the opposite a1 a family
value was not as wide
I will fight for and bring about 12
weeks of paid
family and medical the
all over this country
that's right
all over this country we have working
people
thing when they get sick they go to work
and they go to work because they have no
guaranteed
sick time it's time to end not they
provide guaranteed paid
sick time for every worker in america
you know I think we all heard a few
weeks ago that
jeb bush thinks that the american people
jeb bush leagues the American people
need to work
a little bit hard
Worli obviously didn't heal the sad
reality
that the american people already work
the longest hours %uh any major
country on earth our people do not need
to work longer hours
they need hi all wagers and better a job
now when we talk about
the crises facing
our country when pollsters asked people
what's on your mind
what do you think is most important what
people invariably say is
jobs we need more jobs
well in my view when we have over 30
percent
youth unemployment ten and a half
percent unemployment in general
when our infrastructure our roads
bridges water systems rail
are crumbling we can and should
put millions of people back to work
rebuilding
how crumbling infrastructure
hired introduce legislation that would
put a trillion dollars into our roads
and bridges
which would create up to third see
million jobs
and that is exactly
what we have to do think up in america
where all over this country
our people are rebuilding our slippers
now far behind many other countries
lets her out the best rail system in the
world
but what are people to work doing
and when we talk about creating jobs
we also have to talk about stopping the
loss of jobs
because about disastrous trade policies
you're looking at a senator who voted
against nafta
again after the
against permanent normal trade relations
with China and is leading the opposition
to this disastrous trade TPP
trade again
we need trade policies
which create jobs in on america
we did corporate America to start
investing
in america and not just countries all
over the world
now when we talk
when we talk about what's going on in
this country
but we talk about greed when we talk
about
recklessness when we talk about illegal
behavior
these are John some other words that we
use to describe
Wall Street
today Lee largest
6 financial institutions in this country
have assets absorb 10 trillion dollars
acquittal in the sixty percent to the
GDP
of America
after we bailed them out because
they were too big to fail most to them
%uh now a lot bigger than they were
before we bail them out
in my view if a financial institution
should
is too big to fail it is too big
28 cents
and that is why I have introduced
legislation
to break these huge financial
institutions up
now wanna talk very briefly
about an issue which in many ways
maybe more important then any
other and that is that is a result
of the disastrous Supreme Court decision
in the Citizens United case
the American political system has been
totally corrupted
and the foundations of American
democracy
lobbying undermines
what the supreme court said
to the wealthiest people in our country
they said okay guys
you already own much should the economy
we're now going to give you the
opportunity
to all alone the United States
government and that is what they are
trying to do
in this campaign the Koch brothers on
low
the snack 10 wealthiest family in
America
will be spending almost a billion
dollars
in this campaign cycle that is more
money
then I for the Democratic or Republican
Party's
on spending when one family spends more
money than either of the two major
political parties that is not democracy
bodies I look cokie
and that is why we have got to overturn
Citizens United
and why do we need public funding
other elections
i wont I see a lot of young people here
today
the
in our ward our young people to be able
to
run for office if they want to do and
not have to big money
for the rich and the powerful to dole
out
and now that we have a lot of young
people here let me mention another issue
a bit bored and so are you right now
all love you know that we live as a
nation in a highly competitive
global economy and if we are going to
succeed into the future
we need the best educated workforce
in the world
at this moment if you can believe that
this is how crazy it is
there are hundreds of thousands albright
hard-working qualified young people
for unable to get a college education
not because they don't have the ability
but because their family
does it how the money
so 13th Ramon but what it means the sum
kid
some low-income kids a working-class kid
who wants to make it into the middle
class
but can't go to college because his
family
lacks the funds that's wrong and that is
why
I have introduced legislation and will
fight for his president
to make every public collagen university
in America
to your kid great the
and I want you I want you to think for a
moment
I want you to think for a moment what
free public college
and three public university will mean
what it will be what it will be is not
only
helping kids was seniors or juniors in
high school
what it will tell kids in the fourth
grade in the sixth grade
here in Phoenix or Burlington Vermont
that no matter
how poor you may be if you study hard
you do well in school you can in fact
get
all the education unique
and the other higher education the other
higher education issue that we've got to
deal with
is the absurdity %uh millions of
Americans some young good some not so
young
for carrying out regis student
debt
I may not talkin not just 50,000 on a
hundred thousand I talk to young woman
graduated dental school four hundred
thousand dollars in debt
what my legislation would do
is and the absurdity up people with
student debt
paying eight nine ten percent interest
rates
the
if you can refinance your home
at two or three percent there shouldn't
be paid
percent by Justin
and we have also Cox against the US
government
out of the business are profiteering
what's new today
the
there is
a nother issue that is up such great
importance
the Pope Francis in a recent and
cyclical
focus on it and by the way
god bless Pope Francis co-signer
the
you know I think sometimes people think
by economic views are radical
you should do with this guy is so when
he talks about money
being God modern civilization people
worshipping money
rather than their brothers in their
sisters but what he wrote about in his
recent encyclical
is what virtually the entire scientific
community is telling us
and that is that we have a moral
obligation
as adults and parents to leave
this planet to our kids and
grandchildren
in a habitable way
climate change Israel
climate change is caused by human
activity
climate change is already causing
devastating problems
in our country and all OVR the world
we must
leave the world in an extremely
aggressive way
in breaking our dependence on fossil
fuels
in movie
in moving to win so long geothermal
and other sustainable energies
and here's what the scientists tell us
they say if we do not do that
by the end of this century
this planet will be between five and ten
degrees Fahrenheit warm
and what that will mean is more droughts
more flooding more extreme weather
disturbances
more acidification of the ocean more
more international conflict
his country's fight force castle not
rule
resources we have a moral obligation
to leave the world in transforming
our energy system
and when we talk
about rights and when we talk about how
the united states and
many respects lags behind other
countries there is no
issue in which side is clear all then
the issue
Aug health care
today the United States of America
is the only major country on earth
that does not guarantee health care to
all people
as the right
together you and I are going to end
died in Paris vid because
we are gonna pass a Medicare for All
single-payer program
we can do it we can't do it healthcare
must be seen as a rights not a privilege
what we
have also got to do is we transform
America is to understand a very simple
point and I'm the only candidate for
president who will tell you this
but it is the truth and that is
no president none no matter how good he
or she may be
can bring about the changes that we need
desperately need
in this country on last there is a
political
revolution
and what that political revolution means
is that people all over america
have got to stand up and b.com
involved in the political process in a
way we have never done
before
we have got to also is part of that
revolution
have real debate on real issues which is
what I'm trying to do tonight I want you
to do me a favor I want you to talk
go out to be a zone of comfort I want
you to talk to your republican friends
and family members
now here's the boy here's a boy here's
the boy
it is one thing for the billionaire
class
to be voting republican
but there are many republicans out there
you know them these people are working
to two or three jobs
they have no health care their kids can
afford to go to college
and yet they're voting against people
who are fighting against their best
address
every single day
ask your republican friends why they
vote for folks
who want to tax breaks for billionaires
yet they want to cut Social Security
and Medicare
passcode why they're voting for people
you're gonna throw out onto the street
shut down their factories
and move their plants abroad so what we
need to do
is to create a political movement
a political movement which brings our
people
together what republicans
what republicans are very good at is not
talking about
what they really belief you have never
seen an airhead
on TV would says vote for me so I could
cut your social security
I give a tax break two billionaires
but that is exactly wat they Aug
trying to do now how do they get away
with this stuff I'll tell you how
de tocqueville i dont stop by race
by country of origin
by sexual orientation by John Doe
they say they say no whites worry about
blacks they say the native-born
Americans
worry about immigrants they say the man
worry about
women our job is not to divide
our job is to bring people together
the
and when we talk about bringing
one day should together we have got to
understand that today
in america there are any Lavigne
million people living in the shadows
people who are afraid that they could be
deported
to borrow that is wrong we need Capri
had served immigration
rOFLOL the
we a path toward citizenship
for undocumented people we need not to
be dividing families
waiting to be united families are
keeping them
together the
now in our country there is a lock
that we should be proud of we have made
significant progress
in recent years in breaking down many
barriers
up discrimination if we were sitting
here
or in your case standing here
thirty years ago and somebody said you
know I have a crazy idea I think
that may be in 2008 the United States
will have overcome
its racist history an elected
african-american to be president people
would have said that's crazy
that will happen it happen because we
overcame unlock abrasives
plotline auspey very clear while we have
overcome
a lot of racism we have come a long way
we still have
a wall on way to go
it is not acceptable
to me and I know to you that an
african-american baby a male baby born
today
if we do not change things stands 81
in four chance up being in prison
during his life
it is not acceptable to be that we have
seen
young black man walk down streets in
this country
be beaten and be killed on joycelyn
that is not acceptable boasts police
officers I was a male
I was a mayor for eight years and I
worked
with the police what it's a tough job
both cops do it well
but when a police office of breaks the
law
that office of must be held accountable
why
luxury let me conclude by saying this I
want you all to
think big knock think small
i watch youtube all appreciate that you
are living
in the wealthiest country today in the
history of the world
the wealthiest country but nobody knows
it
because all all the wealth rest in the
hands
but a few
so what we need to do is to have a
vision
where it says said well and income
become spread out in a way
then is fair what we need
to do is to have
a vision that says that every
person in this country is it I'll to
health care
as the right
that when a mom or dad goes to work
he or she knows let their kid
in a trial care center where pre-k will
get the best
quality care available
I am the former chairman
of the senate veterans committee an IRA
we'll tell you that in this country
we have a moral obligation to make sure
that every
veteran every man and woman to put their
lives on the line
to defend his country tax payer
healthcare and the benefits they do
we are not good at the fair when I go to
turn our backs
on our veterans
we are going to be a nation
and we are going to create a nation
where everyone
no matter their race their religion
their disability or their sexual
orientation
realizes the full potential other
quality
that is the birthright Americans
I
several years ago I attended a meeting
in northern Vermont
which was honoring veterans who fought
world war to end at the beginning of
that meeting somebody played a tape
video tape
booking at Franklin Delano Roosevelt on
December 8 1941
and I was the day after pearl harbor
and what roosevelt was doing that day
was the clearing mortgage dependent so
do declare war against
Hitler in Germany on that day the United
States was unprepared to fight one war
let alone two wars but in two and a half
years
because this country focus by creating
the best military in the world
produce enough to banks are the plane's
and because we do
we won that war in two and a half years
so I don't want anybody to tell me
that this country when we bought our
minds to it
cannot guarantee health care at all
dog pound me we can't leave the world
in combating climate change what have
the best infrastructure
in the world
dog pound me don't tell me cuz I don't
believe it
there we can create a system where all
of our kids
get a great education
but not if this comes easy
Frederick Douglass the great
abolitionist told us
that freedom does not calm without
struggle I need you
because this is not about me it's about
costs we
to stand together to make not political
revolution
where we create and America
any government that works for all of us
we can do it when we stand up
we can't do it when we stand off and
Saturday
are not is a knot the billionaire so I'm
not gonna have it all
it's our country blacks create dad Asian
thank you all very much
home

America thank you for putting on this
important conference let me from the
slot suggests I am NOT Frank Underwood
talking about is wrenching the hearts of
the american people
consciousness on criminal justice reform
has risen significantly in the last
couple of years a lot of that has to do
with this kind of invention here where
for years a lot of crimes were being
committed that were not being talked
about but now when they get video would
make it on television they are being
talked about and that is a very very
good thing and lose clearly time that we
start talking as we have in this
election about the really disastrous
effects of too many politicians trying
to too many elections by locking too
many people remember we're going to be
tough on crime and throw away the key
we're gonna do this look into that all
of that has resulted in an international
disgrace that all of you know it at the
united states of america today has more
people in jail than any other country on
earth including China which is
authoritarianism communist country four
times our thoughts and we as a people
have to leave this issue right on the
table and that is that people in
American jails are disproportionately to
a very significant degree people of
color and that is the reality in america
today and that is a reality that has to
change too many lives to too many lives
are being destroyed and together we are
going to bring about major reforms of a
broken criminal justice system with an
issue that is on everyone's mind and
that is the continuing struggle for
racial justice in american let's talk
with the facts these are not pleasant
facts but these are facts we have got to
discuss if current trends continue
approximately one in four black males
born today a child born here in South
Carolina today can expect to spend time
in prison during his lifetime
this is an unspeakable tragedy blacks
are in prison and six times the rate of
white people of color are incarcerated
police and sentenced to death at
significantly higher rates than their
white counterparts one in every 15
african-american men is incarcerated
compared to one in every 100 and six
whiteman a report by the Department of
Justice found that blacks were three
times more likely to be searched during
a traffic stop
compared to white motorists
african-americans are twice as likely to
be arrested and almost four times as
likely to experience the use of force
during encounter is with the police
african-americans make up two fifths of
confined youth today
african-american women are three times
more likely than white women to be
incarcerated once conducted black
offenders received longer sentences 10
percent longer than wide offenders for
the same exam crimes
thirteen percent of african-american men
have lost the right to vote guilty to
felony convictions and this by the way
is an issue we don't talk about very
much but it is a huge political
consequence 13 percent of
african-american men have lost their
right to vote these shocking statistics
to say the least but before we even
addressed them we have to deal with the
most urgent and obvious issue that needs
to be addressed head-on and that is the
killing of african-americans by police
or deaths while in custody of tragedies
we hear about screams out for justice
the black lawyers mountable which has
arisen in response to these deaths has
done a needed and commendable job in
raising public consciousness on this
issue the proliferation of cell phone
video has brought the reality of these
deaths into the living room and onto the
computer screen of millions and millions
of people throughout our country I know
you have heard these names before but
they bear repeating so we do not lose
sight of the real human price being paid
Michael Brown
Scott pretty great plan to me Rice
Samuel Duboce cuboid and many many of us
but people must do more than just echo
the phrase backlight was Matta we must
put actions behind those words
will bring about a fundamental reform
that is needed in the face of this
crisis criminal justice reform must be
the civil rights issue of the 21st
century and the first piece that we must
address is police before the killings of
unarmed African Americans has got to
stop nation too many african-americans
and other minorities find themselves
subjected to a system that treats
citizens who have not committed crimes
as if they were criminals a growing
number of communities do not trust the
police and police have become
disconnected alien to the communities
that they are sworn to protect at the
federal level we need to establish a new
model police training program that
reorient the way we do law enforcement
in this country with input from a broad
segments of the community we must
reinvent how weak police America a
critically important component of this
reform is a set of new rules on the
allowable use of force soul force must
be the last resort not the first result
need to be trained to de-escalate
confrontations and humanely interact
with people who have mental illnesses
someone and by the way this happened to
my own state of Vermont not a military
woman called police because her mentally
ill son was acting out soon got shot and
killed that happens all across this
country we also need police forces that
reflect the diversity of our communities
and I must extend into the leadership of
police departments and into the training
departments clearly we need greater
civilian oversight of police departments
and ongoing and meaningful community
engagement we need to federally fund and
require body covers law enforcement
offices to make it easier to hold them
accountable but we also must establish
standards and processes to protect the
privacy of innocent people our justice
department must aggressively investigate
and prosecute police officers who break
the law and hold them accountable for
their actions
we may need to examine when current
federal civil rights status provides the
justice department to protect the people
of this country we need to require
police departments and states to provide
public reports on all police shootings
and deaths that take place while in
police custody and the federal
government should provide funding to
help state and local governments adopt
these new policing standards state and
local governments participate in police
reform should be rewarded by the federal
government
those who do not have federal Justice
funding withheld and very importantly we
must
militarize police departments around
this country look at the television and
it looks like there is an invading army
looks like you're in iraq rather than
looking at a local police department
also got to establish standards and
crack down on communities that are using
their police forces essentially as
revenue generators communities that
receive an inordinate amount of the
local funding
fines and citations need to be stopped
we have to deal with the level of
policing in african-american communities
across this country there is a strong
sense many activists and others that I
have spoken to their PR is over policing
in some African American communities now
I know that some will say that's because
there is more crime in those poor black
urban communities but if we jump to that
conclusion we should examine recent 2014
Bureau of Justice Statistics report
examining the relationship between
household poverty and non lethal violent
victimization which includes rape sexual
assault robbery aggravated assault and
simple assault and this is what it found
that the period studied from 2008
through 2012
people living in urban areas had violent
victimization rates similar to poor
people living in rural areas
core urban blacks had rates of violence
similar to poor urban whites represented
vermont a rural state and I have to tell
you that I do not see the level of
intensity of policing that we seem to
see in so many cities around the country
now of course people committing violent
crimes need to be apprehended tried by a
jury of their peers and if they are
convicted they need to go to jail nobody
debates that we want criminals and
people who are dangerous floor abiding
people off the streets and let me also
say and I say this is a former mayor
somebody work very closely with the
Burlington Vermont police department
that took place
authority of police officers in this
country are honest they are working hard
and they do a good job on the very very
difficult circumstances however we
cannot ignore the fact that the majority
of people living in our cities are
trying to work hard to play by the rules
and to raise their children safely there
are neighborhoods in this country and
you'll notice where mothers hard to
believe in America but it's true
where mothers are afraid to let their
children outside go outside for fear of
gang violence and drugs and we owe it to
those mothers to get dangerous people
off the streets but mothers should not
be afraid of their children being
targeted by the police because of the
color of their skin and that a routine
interaction with law enforcement and in
an appropriate force or even death we do
not want any mobile in America have to
worry about that but of course criminal
justice reform goes well beyond
reforming police departments we have to
rethink our entire approach we cannot
jail our way out of health problems like
drug addiction or social and economic
problems like poverty we must end the
over incarceration of nonviolent young
Americans who do not pose a serious
threat to our society african-americans
comprise fourteen percent of regular
drug uses but all 37 percent
of those arrested for drug offenses from
1980 to 2007 about one in three adults
arrested for drugs in the United States
was african-american know how many think
about this how many encounters between
young people and the police begin with
officers detecting the odor of marijuana
unacceptable to me that we stigmatize so
many young americans with a criminal
record for possessing marijuana but at
the same time not one major CEO of a
Wall Street bank was illegal activities
helped destroy the economy of the united
states not one of them has a police
record
criminal justice system which says that
a not only is a bank too big to fail but
bankers to pick to jail and by the way
all of that the fact that hundreds and
hundreds of lines of young people have
been destroyed because records for
smoking marijuana and the fact that no
CEOs of Wall Street firms get police
records all of this has a huge impact on
people's attitude toward the government
justice upon fairness but in that regard
our attitude toward marijuana must
change i'm happy to tell you the live
introduced legislation which takes
marijuana off of the federal list of
controlled substances it is frankly
absurd under the Controlled Substances
Act that marijuana is a schedule 1 drug
alongside of heroin makes no sense at
all to me so we want to get the federal
government out of the business of making
marijuana illegal if states want to go
forward that is their right to do that
and they should be able to do that
without legal impediments from the
federal government
furthermore when we talk about reforming
a broken criminal justice system we need
to end prisons for profit
introduced legislation to do that and as
President I will make that happen
it is simply wrong for corporations to
be making profits through the
incarceration of fellow Americans or
running detention centers that is not an
area where people should be making
profits furthermore have got to invest
in drug courts and interventions for
people with substance abuse problems our
goal must be that people with substance
abuse problems and by the way this is a
huge problem from one end of this
country that the other huge problem in
my sleep because all you know not a drug
problem we have a very serious problem
with opiates and heroin is a problem all
over america but what we must understand
is that substance abuse is a disease not
a crime and we've got a treated as a
health issue and in that regard we have
got to do a lot lot better with mental
health in america we need a revolution
in how we treat mental health when
people want to get off at Haringey
heroin get off with opiates they should
be able to get into a treatment center
and get the care they need not have to
wait but to use
in addition we need to end mandatory
minimum sentencing and give judges the
discretion to better tailor sentences to
the specific facts of a given case as
you know judges often now do not have
discretion
the federal system of perot needs to be
reinstated for people who are serving
long sentences there needs to be an
incentive for people to make different
choices and earn their way to a shorter
sentence and a path to a productive like
people who committed crimes that i've
landed them in jail there needs to be a
pair back from prison and that includes
a restoration of full voting rights I
don't have to tell you that by and large
we do a pretty bad job in making sure
that when people are released from jail
on end up in jail again clearly you
don't have to be a criminologist
understand that if somebody leaves jail
without job training without education
without money without housing the oslo
that they will fall back into the same
environment they got him in jail in the
first place and that is a waste of human
life and that is a huge waste of
taxpayers dollars and we have got to end
move away from over incarceration there
are a number of systemic issues that we
must address but let me just mention to
them now
first is the disparity in education for
children in poor communities and poor
communities of color in particular black
children who make up just 18 percent of
preschoolers account 48% of all out of
school suspensions before kindergarten
and not just tells you how systemic this
problem is a leading black children be
for kindergarten blacks were expelled at
three times the rate of white children
black girls were suspended at higher
rates than all of the girls and most
boys according to the Department of
Education african-american students are
more likely to suffer harsh punishments
suspensions and arrest at school we must
address the lingering on just
stereotypes that lead us to label black
youth sands bugs was super predators
southern part of my state there was a
principal she's retired was absolutely
fierce and determined that kids in her
high school would not drop out of school
she would personally kill them if they
dropped out of school she knew all of
these kids she assigned menteur more
available 24 hours a day seven days a
week sort of kid out of family problem
at three o'clock in the morning there
was somebody that you could call it a
kid was dealing with drugs or getting
involved in that the mental was there
the truth of the matter is if we are
serious about keeping kids out of jail
if we are serious about making sure our
kids are in school or have jobs yes we
can do that we do not need to allow
millions of kids don't fall through the
cracks to hang out on street corners to
get into trouble down the jail and to
see their lives destroyed we need to
give all of our kids regardless of their
income
shot at attending college now my parents
never went to college
dad dropped out of high school my mother
graduated high school and in our family
which was lower middle class we don't
know many people who want two cultures
there are millions of kids in this
country
parents level at the college they don't
know anybody who went to college and the
idea of getting a higher education is
about is meaningful to them is going to
the moon and that is why I have
introduced legislation and will make
happen as president a process by which
every public college and university in
America
is tuition free import well we know the
obvious reasons why some people out of
school deeply in debt and so forth but
here is a more important but what should
I think about it because it really is
revolutionary
sends is that every child in America
weather in my home town of Burlington
Vermont in Columbia South Carolina if
you do your school work well if you pay
attention if you are serious about
school you will be able to go to college
regardless of the income of your family
millions objects and teaches will have
hope and belief that they can make it
into the middle class if they do well in
school we have to stop the
criminalisation of classroom misbehavior
in this room by the video that we
recently saw of the resource officer
throwing a young girl across the room
right here in South Carolina there is a
pipeline from school to jail that we
have to turn into a pipeline from school
to a promising future
the second issue that we have got to
deal with because all of these issues
are interrelated
have to be dealt with in a holistic
model is the issue of poverty we are
living today
in the wealthiest country in the history
of the world very few people know that
because most of the well almost all of
the well in almost all of the income
being generated today goes to the top
one percent we have 40
seven million people in america living
in poverty and shamefully and this is a
total disgrace the highest rate of
childhood poverty of almost any major
country on earth twenty percent of
markets close to forty percent of
african-american kids now you tell me
the justice of a society in which the
top one tenth of one percent is almost
as much well as the bottom 90% tell me
the justice of a society in which we are
seeing a proliferation of millionaires
and billionaires and yet we have the
highest rate of childhood poverty of
almost any major country on earth that
is a disgrace that is not what America
is supposed to be about and together we
are going to end
Americans don't have ten thousand
dollars in savings marginal wealthiest
country in the history of the world
majority of people in this country do
not have $10,000 what happens the other
automobile accident what happens if you
get sick what I and millions of
Americans age 50 50 50 in the bank they
have no clue as to how they gonna retire
with dignity most black and Latino
households have less than three hundred
and fifty dollars in savings the black
unemployment rate has remained roughly
twice as high as the white rate
rate over the last 40 years regardless
of Education let me tell you the story i
guess im economists'
go to a study for me I asked them to
tell me what the rate of real
unemployment that is unemployment and
underemployment for young people
this country's 17 to 24 graduated high
school didn't drop out
graduated high school this is what they
said white kids 33 percent latino kids
that's an entire generation of kids
graduating high school wanna get their
feet on the ground want to get out of
the house 10 slot their adult lives not
been out there for them so let me repeat
it makes a lot more sense for us to
invest in education and jobs rather than
jails and incarceration will give you a
long speech about how we deal with the
collapse of the American middle class 47
million people living in poverty but
this is what I will tell you we've got
to create millions of jobs in this
country when we do it is by rebuilding
our crumbling infrastructure put
thirteen million people back to work
good-paying jobs another thing that
we've got to do is recognize let us
$7.25 minimum wage is a starvation wage
got a raise the minimum wage to a living
wage 15
access terms not payday lenders
you know the truth is that is very
expensive to be poor you know what I
mean by that
a cashier check your paying outrageous
sum of money not able to get a bank
account in a normal bank we gotta change
those things let me just conclude thank
you all very much for holding this
conference on an issue I get around the
country all these issues that we're
talking about today are on the minds of
millions and millions of Americans not
just african-americans but the entire
community we want to live in a nation in
which we're not spending eighty billion
dollars a year locking up our neighbors
we want to live in a nation where an
african-american get in to his or her
call and not worry about being dragged
out of the call can be found dead three
days later in a jail so we got a lot of
work in front of us but this is an issue
for my mind of enormous importance
it's an issue that we can and must work
on together
absolute confidence that when we come
together this is an issue can be
resolved thank you

today the richest people in our country
on more wealth than the bottom half of
the american population hundred and
fifty million people they know that the
system is rigged when the average person
is a girl hours
wages and yet 58%
executives on Wall Street
over the economic and political life of
our country and most people though in
the nineteen nineties and later the
financial interests spend billions of
dollars on campaign contributions to
force through congress the deregulation
of Wall Street the repeal of the
glass-steagall Act and the weekend of
consumer protection was all across our
country this money in order to get the
government or their backs and to show
the american people what they could do
with this new one
freedom from regulation
well the short show the american people
in 2008 the reckless this illegal
behavior on Wall Street nearly destroy
the American and global economy millions
of Americans lost their jobs they lost
their homes and they lost their life
savings while Wall Street received the
largest taxpayer bailout in the history
of the world with no strings attached
the American middle class continues to
disappear
poverty is increasing and the gap
between the very rich and everyone else
continues to grow and Wall Street
executives still receive compensation
packages as if the financial crisis they
created never happened
dishonesty and arrogance these are some
of the words that best describe the
reality of Wall Street today
president
political
the wealthiest Americans in this country
at the expense of everyone else while
President Obama deserves credit for
improving
this economy
to create a financial system and an
economy that works for all our people
not just a handful of billionaire
medium-sized businesses create decent
jobs
continue the taxpayers of this country
bailed out Wall Street because we were
told that they were too big
yesterday today three out of the four
largest financial institutions JPMorgan
Chase Bank of America and Wells Fargo
are nearly 80%
then before we bailed them out because
they would choose to fail
six largest banks in this country
issue than two-thirds of all credit
cards and woolen 35% of all mortgages
they controlled more than 95% of all
financial derivatives and hold more than
40% of all bank deposits their assets
today or equivalent to nearly 60% of the
GEB of United States of America
it is to risk perspective and the fear
of another bellow it is also true from
the reality that a handful of huge
financial institutions simply have too
much economic and political power over
this country
the Republican trust us were alive today
he would say rain and he would be 100 I
will require the Secretary of the
Treasury Department to establish a too
big to fail list of commercial banks and
insurance companies
fairly would pose a catastrophic risk to
the United States economy without a tax
bill O
dog we need to do is commit to do as
president of the united clicks
something that would have been been
under the glass steagle act
president bill into precisely to prevent
Wall Street speculators from closing
another Great Depression for more than
five decades untold Wall Street watered
it down under president reagan and
killed on the president clinton the
Federal Reserve and the Treasury
Department did Josh banks as a result of
an amendment that I ordered the
emergency lending activities of the
federal reserve during the financial
crisis we learn that the Fed provided
more than six trillion dollars in
short-term low-interest loans to every
major financial institution in this
country including Citigroup JPMorgan
Chase Bank of America Wells Fargo not to
mention water corporations and banks and
foreign central banks throughout the
world
secretary Clinton's we just need to
impose a few more fees and regulations
on the financial industry I disagree
Secretary of Labor robert rice
woes John Wall Street banks continue to
threaten the well-being of millions of
Americans but what does break them up
and resurrect the glass one separated
investment from commercial banking
Hillary Clinton says charge from a bit
more and oversee them more carefully
hillary clinton's proposals only in Shin
and we all the way to contain the
streets excess is so big bull in public
they can't be watered down
politicians to cut it out
dissolution that is so spread is the
understanding our criminal justice
system is broken and grossly unfair
and we do not have these kids and
sometimes even jail for possessing or
other minor crimes but when it comes to
Wall Street executives some of the
wealthiest and most powerful people in
this country
illegal behavior causes pain and
suffering while millions of Americans
nothing happens to them
million jobs home savings book for the
CEO of Wall Street no no jail time no
justice criminal justice system which
room or does not dispense justice
has ever been prosecuted for posing the
near-collapse of our entire economy will
change on the ball
or reaching settlements unfair and
deceptive activities some people believe
that this is an operation that we have
an honest financial system in which
every now and then major financial
institutions do something wrong and
court in my view the evidence suggests
that would be incorrect and ours is the
business model of Wall Street
the role regulatory the likelihood is
that Wall Street get away with a lot
more illegal behavior we know how many
times have we heard them if they have
been wrong but it wasn't illegal let me
help today
major financial institutions in this
country have been fined two hundred and
four billion dollars two hundred billion
dollars and that once again takes place
in a week
regulatory environment of when major
banks were doing illegal active in
August 2014 Bank of America settled the
case with the department of justice for
more than sixteen billion dollars on
charges that the bank misled investors
about the riskiness of mortgage-backed

crisis in November of 2000 and 3000

creating

from wall street
credit agencies did not give these
worthless financial products triple-a
ratings ratings
if that works for all americans we have

charging sky-high interest rates and

charge of regulating would be shocked to
know their Jamie Dimon the CEO of JP
served on the board of the New York Fed
at the same time that he received a
three hundred and ninety one billion
dollar bailout from the Federal Reserve
conflict of interest that I will as
president
boxes to be guarding the hen house at
the banking industry will be able to
serve on the boards and handpick its
members and special interest money out
of the economy and parked at the Fed
excess reserves of financial
institutions that are sitting in the
Federal Reserve have grown from less
than two billion in 2008 22 points for
Trillian dollars today that is absurd
instead of paying interest on these
reserves should be charged a fee that
could be used to provide affordable
loans to small businesses to create jobs
will tell you or anyone else can
effectively address crises facing the
working families of this country alone
no president can do it alone
the truth is that Wall Street corporate
America corporate media and wealthy
campaign donors are just too what this
campaign is building a political move
which revitalizes american democracy
which brings millions of people together
black white Latino Asian American Native
American native and immigrant people
enormous economic and political makes
huge campaign contributions they have
thousands of obvious and they provide
very generous speaking fees to those who
go before them has an endless supply of
money but we have something they don't
have and that is when millions of
working families together to make
fundamental changes in our lives we have
the power to bring about that change
not just a handful of wealthy
speculators and now more than ample that
is exactly what we must do to you today
is simple and straightforward if elected
president I will rein in Wall Street so
they cannot crash our economy again
on wall street like the No
thank you all

thank all of you here this afternoon
before I begin my remarks
let me give you a very short thumbnail
sketch of my political life because my
journey here to washington D C has been
a little bit different than many of my
colleagues join mention I was born in
Brooklyn New York 1941 my father came to
this country from Poland at the age of
17 without a penny in his pocket and
without much of an educational I always
think back about bravery was his as well
as many other millions of people who
came to this country with so little my
mom graduated high school in New York
City my dad worked for almost his entire
life as a paint salesman and we were
solidly lower-middle-class my parents my
brother and I believed in a small
rent-controlled apartment my mother's
dream was to move out of that small
apartment and i own a home of her own
she died young and she never fulfilled
that dream as a kid in many many ways I
learnt a lot of money means to a family
and that is a lesson
I have never forgot my wife Jane and I
have been married for 27 years we r for
break loose and seven beautiful
grandchildren and without trying to be
overly dramatic about it what motivates
me politically why I do what I do is to
make sure that these kids and all of our
children can live in a wonderful country
and a wonderful world representing the
great state of Vermont join indicated
the longest-serving independent in
american congressional history I served
16 years in the house and Vermont's lone
congressman in a 2006 I was elected to
the Senate reelected in 2012 I began my
rather unusual political career back in
1971 is a candidate for the US Senate on
a small third party called liberty and I
received two percent of the world not
dissuaded governor of the state of
Vermont and received one percent of all
not be the brightest light on the block
I ran again for the senate and received
four percent of the vote two years later
after governor and received sixty
percent of the vote I thought I would
give people want to break and I retired
from politics in 1976 remembering one
particular going said burning I promise
I will vote for you if you promise that
you will never run for office again in
1981 I was persuaded by some friends to
run for mayor of Burlington the largest
city in our state against the five-term
Democrat democratic mayor I ran as an
independent nobody but nobody thought we
had a chance to win we do not very
remarkable election we put together an
extraordinary coalition of workers and
trade unionists of environmentalists of
neighborhood activist low-income
organizations of women's groups of
college students and that type of
coalition politics are bringing people
together around a progressive agenda
changed my view of politics today in a
campaign which costs about $4,000 I the
people who supported me not on thousands
of doors in the city and let me tell you
it gets cold in Vermont in March
on election night when the votes were
counted we want the working class once
by something like two to one and won the
election by all of 40 boats it was the
biggest political upset in modern
history and after reading the margin of
victory was reduced to 10 goals without
going into any great lengths to your
local office with 11 out of the 13
members of the City Council Democrats
and Republicans in very strong
opposition to my agenda and trust those
of you in this room
think the president Obama has gotten a
rough time for republicans that was
nothing compared to what I am i
supported experience during my first
journal but one year later
of what we were attempting to do and
what we wanted to do a slate of
candidates working with me
defeated a number of the incumbent
obstructionists a year after that
election in which the voter turnout was
almost double what it was when I was
first elected i pretty easily defeated
Democratic and Republican candidates
continue to get reelected in my last
election defeated a candidate from both
political parties 1988 I ran for the US
Congress in a three-way race I came in
second with thirty eight percent of the
vote two years later won election 16
percent of winning with over 16 percent
more than my opponent in 2006 with
retirement of senator jim jeffords and
with the support of them
I one per month senate seat to go to the
wealthiest person in the state of
Vermont a candidate who spent three
times more money than anyone had ever
spent before and I'll say just three and
already very very negative rates I want
with 67 percent of the vote in a 2012
re-election with 71% as mayor of
Burlington my administration took on
virtually every special and powerful
interest in the city and in the state
against the wishes of developers and the
railroads we created a beautiful people
oriented waterfront and a bike path
along the way they Champlain we
developed the first municipal housing
land trusts in the country for a
portable housing we won national
recognition Berlin beautification by
planting thousands of trees throughout
the city and we make major improvements
in our streets and sidewalks we
implemented the largest environmental
program then in the state's history by
building a new wastewater facility for
that untreated waste going into the lake
we sought to use laws which created a
beautiful day casts a little program
after school programs and a team set up
all of which continue to exist today
with the first city in vermont to break
its dependence on the regressive
property tax we made major changes in
Burlington police dept moving in the
direction of community policing we saw a
very active and successful loss program
and Women's Council results for the last
several decades Burlington has been
considered to be one of the most
beautiful and livable cities in America
all of you not only the business
Burlington but the visit of beautiful
state of Vermont 1992 became first
independent elected to the US House and
forty years and during my first year
there along with four other house
members of the Congressional Progressive
Caucus which sounds today it's one of
the largest and most important caucuses
in congress doing a great job
representing the working of our country
one of the first votes in the house that
I cast was against the first Gulf War I
believe that history will record that
that was the white vote as well
foreign policy blunders in the modern
history of our country and also created
a situation where today hundreds of
thousands 500,000 men and women have
come home from Iraq and Afghanistan with
post-traumatic stress disorder and
traumatic brain injury home without the
law with arms and legs and their
eyesight and that is the course before
we get involved in another war we
remember what is really about
I was one of those against regulation
supported by both Republican and
Democratic leadership in retrospect I
think it is fair to say that most people
today do not believe that it was a great
idea to end class and to allow the greed
recklessness in illegal activity on wall
street to go unchecked
written by corporate america again
supported by democratic to republican
presidents agreements like nafta
permanent normal trade relations with
China and other trade agreements which
have cost us millions of decent paying
jobs and have led this country to a race
to the ball I strongly oppose the
trans-pacific partnership trade house
took on the pharmaceutical industry and
the outrageous prices they charge our
people and became the first member of
Congress to take americans across the
Canadian Auto to purchase prescription
drugs there and I will never forget that
trip where women struggling with press
cancel the medicine they need for 110 in
Montreal in the United States by
understanding today hundreds of
thousands of people have to continue
buying them medicine in canada rather
than the local is the chairman of the
Senate Veterans Committee I worked hard
in a bipartisan way to pass the most
significant veteran's legislation passed
in many many years this legislation over
fifteen billion dollars into improving
veterans healthcare into making certain
that the people who put their lives on
the line to defend us get the best
quality health care possible and get it
in a kindly man and I have
wonderful it is to have been the
recipient of the highest awards from
both the American Legion and VFW and I
am very grateful to them for that
someone wanted to learn about health
care and our dysfunctional health care
system I worked hard with representative
Jim Clyburn to put some twelve billion
dollars in federally qualified community
health centers which resulted in some
four million lower-income Americans
lower-income Americans gaining access to
health care dental care prescription
drugs and mental health counseling we
also significantly expand the National
Health Service goal to provide debt
forgiveness for new primary care
physicians the president was very
supportive of these efforts in my view
this program is one of the one of these
success stories of the Affordable Care
around as one of the leaders in the
center trying to combat the global
crisis of climate change won't I hope
past the energy efficiency block grant
program which put billions of dollars
into energy efficiency and sustainable
and working with several of my
colleagues I found the defending social
security costs us and we were successful
in beating back to try to cut programs
cut social security benefits with the
same old veterans from some of the most
powerful people in this country and
that's enough I will continue to make
brief description of political history
let me go to something more important
and that is the future of our country
and what I tell you now I suspect not
too many people who come up here we'll
talk about but as somebody who has been
described as a rugby grandfather to
Schiphol guys on capitol hill I have to
live up to my reputation so I really
rough today in a nation plagued by many
many concerns the most serious problem
we face is the protest growing level of
wealth
profound moral issue is a profound
economic issues and as a result of
citizens united it is a profound
political this is the issue all other
job creation and infrastructure tax
reform health care climate change the
environment education Barbosa
fundamentally impact impacted by income
and well let me tell you what very few
elected officials and that is that given
the incredible power of the billionaire
class over the economic like this
country over politics over me I am
absolutely convinced that the struggle
economically and social justice their
struggle for a strong middle class
struggle for a vibrant democracy in
which elections on not bought by the
wealthy will not be one you know like a
lesson unprecedented grass-roots
movement is the fellow which is prepared
to take on and defeat the power of the
1%
members of congress of those fifty years
ago and many other standing outside of
Martin Luther King small and modest tax
revenue Church in Montgomery I was
reminded that real change never takes
place without trouble without the active
participation of millions of people who
are prepared to stand up and fight for
justice of people who in fact are
prepared to put their lives on line in
those topics the political battle of our
time is not republicans versus democrats
it is not the political games inside the
beltway that preoccupy much of the
media's attention it is not the only
thirty second TBS deployed our airwaves
the political struggle of this moment in
our history is declining middle class of
millions of people working longer hours
for low wages if they are lucky enough
to have tools against the power of a
billionaire class
greed has no end
it is the struggle in american black
white Hispanic Asian Native American
women and men and the income to take
care of their families struggling for
retirement security struggling for a
decent education for their kids probably
by helmet cam broadly what dignity
against the greed of a few on top
apparently want it all of you know for
the last forty years the great middle
class of our country once the envy of
the entire world despite exploding
technology just like increased
productivity despite the global economy
and the increasing trade millions of
Americans today are working longer hours
for low wages and we have more people
living in poverty today that almost any
time in the modern history of america
today real unemployment is not by 0.5%
real unemployment is 11 percent if you
include those workers will given up
looking for work or working time when
they want to work full time employment
is almost 70% and African American youth
unemployment is 30%
law the highest rate of trial the
property of any major country on earth
and despite the modest successful
Affordable Care Act
40 million Americans continue to have no
health insurance while even more are
under heavy co-payments or deductibles
in their trucks policies we remain today
in 2050 the only major country on earth
that does not guarantee healthcare all
people and that is
came to my mind the Occupy Wall Street
movement consider themselves as to why
we are and why they since 1999
middle-class down by almost $5,000 after
adjusting for inflation the median male
work with a $700 less last year than he
did
42 years ago despite an explosion of
technology and productive today than we
were six years ago when bush left office
of course but anyone who does not
understand the suffering in the middle
class and working families about country
are experiencing today and sometimes
that's my perception of capitol hill
here in capitol hill and the rest of the
country I think it's imperative that we
close that gap begin what's going on
with the working families of this
country while the middle class continues
to disappear the wealthiest people in
the largest corporations like doing
phenomenally well and the gap between
the very very rich and everyone else is
growing wider and wider and white top
one percent now only forty-one percent
of the entire wealth of this country
while the bottom sixty percent loans
last then 2% today
credibly the top 10 11 percent now
as much well as the bottom 90% David
Walker 457 billion dollars more wealth
than the bottom forty percent of the
American big the fact of the matter is
over the last forty years we have
witnessed the Robin Hood principal a
reverse an enormous transfer of wealth
from the middle class and the pool the
multi millionaires and billionaires in
1985 share of the nation's well to the
bottom 99% was 36 percent in 2013 down
to just 22.8% if the bottom 90% simply
maintain the same share as it did 30
years ago you would have more than 10
trillion dollars
well is currently the case today we are
doing today which is 11 percent increase
their share of more than a trillion
dollars since the Great Wall Street
collapse
99% of all is going to the top one
percent of people all over this country
struggle they were out to feed their
kids they send their kids to college
childcare worried about their parents
99% generated unless goes to the top one
percent very rich get richer and
everybody else gets poorer
and 25,000 public school is supposed to
be I don't think so that piece of
legislation every piece of legislation
on behalf of the wealthy corporations
tell you you don't know what's going on
in Washington according to media reports
it appears that the Koch brothers are
prepared to spend more money in the next
election that either the Democratic or
Republican parties in other words one of
the second wealthiest families this
country worth approximately a hundred
billion dollars may well have a strong
political presence of the major from a
recent political company that's
developing detailed state of the art
profiles on 250 million Americans giving
the brothers political operation
all the earmarks of a national network
in-house expertise in polling message
testing advertising media buying groups
and automates and mastery of election
law corporate line that aggressive and
usurpation experimentation
operation actually exceeds Republican
National Committee's dollar operation
because they will only get wrong I want
everyone in this room right wing
political power of the two major
political parties in this country what
is the political system
well I think it is not cold democracy it
is cold oligarchy and that is the system
we are rapidly moving and that is a
system we must vigorously
improving economy jobs crisis what we do
we need to rebuild I'll probably a
trillion dollar piece of legislation
roads bridges airports water by the way
support the creation of 30 million
decent paying jobs $7.25 minimum wage
here at the federal level is a
starvation wage we need to raise over a
period of years to $15 an hour nobody
working 40 hours a week in this country
should wear
activity
regulate the six largest financial
institutions assets of sixty percent of
GDP president today you know what he
wants a break them off and he would we
want to break off the United States is
the only major country healthcare
program almost twice as much per capita
it is time for america character every
man woman at Roper public colleges to
try to cut Social Security Medicare
Medicaid needless to say I strongly
disagree
we've got to expand social security not
real tax reform it is not acceptable
that major corporation if the major
corporation taxes will lose a hundred
billion a year in revenue because these
companies money in the Cayman Islands
Bermuda the tax havens for these large
corporations to rejoin America
contribute $100 and by the way my
election campaigns I think the average
contribution $45 and I don't do is fund
raising money and I was thinking if I
was really enormous Lee success
million people a million dollars $100
that would be $300 an enormous sum of
money
one-third of what the Koch brothers
themselves so those caucuses with the
Democrats if you ran with you run as a
Democrat would you run as an independent
right question
getting bolder and bolder and grey or
gray I'll try to think through all these
republican values the republican party
has moved from a moderate centrist party
to a right-wing extremist
once the body of the American working
class
nobody was very few people perceive it
to be the case anymore and people more
and more people all over this country
are looking for alternatives to bodies
that's one of the reasons why one might
wonder what's the negative as you all
know it is awfully hard to run as a
candidate United billionaire billionaire
how do you put together how outside how
you get invited to the base of all due
respect to the media
gotta follow somebody was running as an
independent not to be in some cases
literally impossible to get on the
battle is the third party so those are
the issues we are also trying the
democrats anyway they're really makes
you an independent are you really a
democrat my discussion first victory was
defeating the five-term Democrat
defeated Democrats and Republicans for
many many years this is what I think I
think we have a political system right
now which I mentioned earlier this is
not the party of the white tees up David
Eisenhower and there's no way obviously
focus without I think within the
democratic party you have some great
people you have some really really good
people often don't get the credit they
deserve a mention the progressive caucus
in the house
many progressive in the senate working
night and day for working families so to
me given a member of the Senate
Democrats Republicans so there's not
much question about which caucus would
be enough I want to thank the democratic
leadership in the senate for treating
with very very very decently but to my
mind there's no question but the
democrats of all probable to the
republicans on the issues that concern
if you if you were elected how would you
work with congress there seems to be
gridlock between the White House and
Congress now with that be the same case
if you were in the white house is not
because of the so-called gridlock
every member of congress has a
personality defect and is unable to
communicate with people in the political
party whether people and that hehe
everybody around it just gets this is
what is the case is right now but the
United States Congress is represented
of where the american people out of
touch the American people say raise the
minimum wage tax breaks for billionaires
American people say we have to move
towards sustainable clean energy and
energy efficiency United States Congress
says the Keystone pipeline and on and on
and that is a very important for sure
what happened up a lot of respect and
personal affection
climbed away and his contemporaries and
I think that is a politician one
campaigns of Los only this but if you
would ask me what use major mistake has
been is that he thought that after
putting this extraordinary grassroots
movement of working-class people and
getting elected to the presidency and
then he thought he could sit down with
republicans and negotiate all these fine
agreements he was the only way that any
president taking on the billionaire
class can succeed the only possible way
is to mobilize people to say the
congress guess what this is what you
ought to you all gonna raise the minimum
wage you all gonna create millions of
jobs you all gonna protect our veterans
and I will see you you're not going to
get tax breaks for the rich you all
gonna make college and we are watching
you and if you know who this legislation
you're not going to return to Lowes what
I will say with 100% certain that if we
continue on how the elections in with 63
percent of the people don't vote eighty
percent of which will only get richer
and will continue to dominate what goes
on here so to answer your question any
serious president to watch represent
working mens hostel mobilize people all
over this country to make the congress
they can't refuse to run against them it
would be like to debate the serious
issues facing our country as intelligent
people should be going on
and let me say this again this is how I
always get myself in trouble why we
can't have that if the media that
instead of political let us talk about
the real issues and respect different
points of view but when sixty-three
percent of the people in a poll last
year which political parties control the
house and the senate something is wrong
political consciousness in this country
so what we need simple intelligent
debate on the real issues they see the
American people not more political
gossip who slipped on a banana peel who
said something so I did today but how do
we
transforming our energy system so we can
save the planet from climate change how
do we do with a level not easy stop how
do we do those are the issues that
serious people total transparency people
like yourself should talk about
one person we have in the industrialized
11% about people unemployed today are
you gonna put those people back to work
but are you worried that so few people
have so much political power
those are questions I don't hear very
much about so it turns out I don't know
a whole lot of you know I know what you
know about the rules are quite frankly
from the polls in person at the front
desk I'm gonna close are we getting on
hillary's emails in Washington Dec 02
president and what do you think about
the push by Republicans to have the
federal audit I was involved in dog
friend for the first time in the history
of the united states passed i didnt
tired but during the financial crisis
I think they found out during the
financial crisis six trillion sixteen
trillion dollars was led out to portray
the every financial institution major
financial institution in the united
states and central banks all over the
world
$60 and yet working families today have
to figure out how to pay seven or eight
percent interest rates with their kids
to go to college
maybe we should practice low-interest
loans for working families and those
greedy financial institutions in terms
of that is legislation to live without
here's an example of strange bedfellows
all of which we managed to pass the Fed
doesn't make sense to me
defense in we're running short of time
so try to combine a few of them and you
can jump in cuba pose two wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan if you were president
how would you have responded to the
attacks of September 11 2001 that's one
question and another questioner notes
that you are a big advocate of cutting
defense spending yes this person also
believes your supporter of the f35
program which has come under
criticism is being wasteful so how do
you reconcile that still f35 in
September 11 first voted no but I did
and the reason I did it obviously we
knew pretty good idea
attack on 911 opposed the war in Iraq
and i think is too difficult a simple
things that happen but this is what we
have been Iraq and Afghanistan over the
course of the war in human life as a
very very long at some of my colleagues
help in getting us that was in the
quagmire of Middle East and I will do my
best to oppose right now what you have
is a situation where is an example
Saudi Arabia country control
multi-billion dollar one of the
wealthiest families in the world turns
out that Saudi Arabia has the fourth
largest military budget
in the world now why god's name is the
united states contemplating sending
complex rules into iraq again when you
got the sort of sitting there watching
us do that I think what you have now in
the Middle East is in fact the sole of
his slumping will it be the peaceful
religion believe it will be a nice and I
think it is absolutely
Saudi Arabia Jordan for the countries in
that region to get actively involved in
the effort against the United States and
Western Europe should be supportive but
I do not believe that the United States
should lead

bringing forth but the day-to-day work
that you were doing in terms of job
training in terms of helping small
businesses secure financing and
contracts and the help that you provided
families with counseling when they are
trying to realize the American dream of
homeownership and that just a few of the
areas that you have excelled in a little
bit different than others I am the
longest-serving independent in the
history of the united states congress
and I am running for President of the
United States today within the
Democratic primary and caucus process it
is my belief from the bottom of my heart
I would not be running for president if
I thought otherwise
that given the enormous crisis that this
country faces today
crises that may be more severe than any
time since the great depression of the
nineteen thirties that frankly it is too
late for establishment policies it is
too late for establishment politics it
is too late for establishment economics
we need some new thinking some bold
thinking and most importantly this may
make some people nervous
I think when we have a nation today
where a handful of billion as
unbelievable influence over the economic
and political life of this country there
is nothing significant that we will
accomplish unless we have the courage to
take them on and that is what this
campaign is about that you have outline
for this conference are exactly right
save our cities education jobs and
justice as I get into those things look
first point that I want to make is
perhaps the most important and I do
understand that was some people this is
uncomfortable but I believe it has to be
addressed and that is that the United
States of America two-day
country in the history of the world what
most people don't know that because much
of that well is concentrated in the
hands of a few today in America we have
more wealth and income inequality than
any other major country on earth and it
is worse today than at any time since
to me it is not acceptable that the top
one-tenth of one percent owns almost as
much well as the bottom 90% it is not
acceptable that one family family that
owns more wealth than the bottom of the
american people it is not acceptable in
the last two years the 14 wealthiest
people saw their wealth increased by a
hundred and fifty seven billion dollars
more well that is owned by the bottom
one hundred and thirty million Americans
the truth of the matter is that we can
not run away from that reality income
and wealth inequality is the great moral
issue of our time it is a great economic
issue of our time it is the great social
and political issue of our time and to
get up we must address that issue
a few days ago former President Jimmy
Carter described the American political
system as corrupt he described the
United States as an oligarchy with
unlimited political bribery being the
essence of getting the nomination for
president elected president what he was
talking about is the disastrous Supreme
Court decision in Citizens United
decision which says the wealthiest
people in this country you already own
the economy now we're going to give you
the opportunity to buy the United States
government that decision is undermining
the very foundations of American
democracy what men and women have fought
and given their lives to defend you tell
me what it means when one family the
Koch brothers family will spend more
money on this election cycle than either
the democratic party or the republican
party spent almost a billion dollars to
buy candidates will make the rich richer
and everyone else floral Dr me is not
democracy that is key
that's what we've got to overturn this
disastrous Citizens United decision and
I guarantee you that all of the issues
the candidates have talked about that
you believe it will not take place when
a handful of wealthy people are able to
control our political system now
when we talk about education I trust
that all of you know is that we live in
a highly competitive global economy to
my mind it is insane and I use that word
advised that we have hundreds of
thousands of bright young people often
minorities who have the desire to have
the ability to get a higher education
and go to college but they can't go to
college for the simple reason their
families cannot afford the tuition that
is absurd we need to have the best
educated workforce in the world and not
tell hundreds of thousands of bright
young people that they cannot make it
into the middle class ladylike cannot
contribute as engineers as doctors aside
this and that is why I will fight for
its president to make every public
college and university in America 23
and what that means is that kids in the
fourth grade and in the sixth grade will
know that if they study hard pay
attention to their school work even if
their parents like my parents did you go
to college kids in the neighborhood did
not go to college they will be able to
go to college because the incomes of
their families will not be a determining
factor this will revolutionize education
I think and when we talk about education
but we also have to understand to be
frank is the world has changed since the
nineteen forties and fifties mom is in
the workplace dad is in the workplace we
need a first-class child-care pre-k
in this country in my state and all over
this country working class families
struggling to find affordable quality
child care child care workers are paid
minimum wage that is not how we treat
the most vulnerable children in America
universal pre-k teacher obviously a word
about jobs you read every month that
unemployment is 5.3 percent government
comes out with a statistic please know
that that statistic is only one of many
statistics the government releases are
drops that statistic does not include
those people were given up looking for
work and those people working part-time
millions when they want to work full
time real unemployment is that 5.3% it
is 10.5% it is a crisis and I'll let me
tell you what very few people are
talking about which is an even greater
crisis and ideas
youth unemployment which we don't talk
about at all I ask paul asked the study
for an economic policy and
and they came up with the results that
nobody is questioning let's do this if
you are a white kid between 17 and 22
graduates high school you have a 33
percent unemployment right if you are an
hispanic did you have a 36 percent
unemployment rate if you are an
african-american kids seventeen to
twenty high school graduate
have a 51 percent unemployment rate that
is unacceptable that is turning our
backs on an entire generation and we
must not allow that to continue now when
people talk about but ratcheting up the
United States having more people in jail
than any other country including China
one of the contributing factors is that
we got five and a half million young
people that america in my state in your
states without education hanging around
on street corners doing bad things
it is a very strong opinion that it
makes a lot more sets for us to be
investing in jobs and education rather
than jails and it cost inflation
along with representative john conyers I
introduced legislation that would create
one million jobs over the next several
years for unemployed and that is why I
have introduced legislation that calls
for a trillion dollar investment in
rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure
creating thirteen million decent paying
jobs and when we talk about jobs and
income
let me be very clear to $7.25 minimum
wage that exists nationally is in my
view a starvation wage and that is why
the last week alongside the fast food
industry was standing up and fighting
for dignity I introduced the legislation
that will move us to $15 an hour minimum
wage over the next few years has done a
lot of good things but we should
understand that the United States today
remains the only major country on earth
does not guarantee health care of all
people as a right and that is why I will
continue fighting and introduce
legislation for a Medicare for All
single-payer program guaranteeing health
care every man woman and trial justice
when we talk about the need for all
people in america to be treated equally
and with dignity
we've got a deal with some hard
realities and those realities include
the fact that today if you can believe
it and I know UK
one in four black males today can expect
to spend time in prison during their
lifetime unless we change that
dynamics this is an unspeakable tragedy
and this country can no longer ignore
that blacks are in prison at six times
the rate of whites a report by the
Department of Justice found that blacks
what three times more likely to be
searched during a traffic stop
compared to white motorists
african-americans are twice as likely to
be arrested and almost four times as
likely to experience to use of thoughts
during encounters with police
13% in this is an extraordinary figure I
think not an accident
thirteen percent of african-american men
have lost the right to vote due to
felony convictions can't participate in
the democratic political process now in
my view we need some major changes in
criminal justice in America and is
president of the united states I promise
you my justice will be vigorous in
fighting all forms of discrimination in
every area of our life not only in
police matters but in housing in credit
in every area it impacts minority
populations across our nation is all of
you know and we see almost every day too
many african-americans and other
minorities find themselves subjected to
a system there treat citizens who have
not committed crimes as if they were
criminals a growing number of
communities throughout this country do
not trust the police and police have
become disconnected
from the communities they are sworn to
protect what i was mayor of Burlington
Vermont the largest city in the state
one of the things that we did and I
believe this very strongly as we move
toward community policing community
policing means that police are part of
the community
not seen as a presses in the community
and that is the direction that we've got
to move Cidre bland Michael Braun Rickie
avoid a Ricardo Walter Scott pretty
great to me Rice Samuel most we know
their names each of them died at the
hands of police offices or in police
custody let us all be very clear
violence and brutality of any kind
particularly at the hands of law
enforcement sworn to protect and serve
their communities is unacceptable and
must not be tolerated
we must reform our criminal justice
system black lives do matter and we must
value black lights we must move away
from the militarization of police forces
have all seen on TV this heavy duty
equipment looks like they're invading
the city going to war and that is not
the signal that police should be sending
around this country believes should be
part of the community
not an impressive plus we need a justice
department which takes the lead in
working with states and localities to
train police offices for us should be
the last resort not the first resort
what people who have committed crimes
that i've landed them in jail there
needs to be a path back to prison
the recidivism rate in this country is
incredibly high people go to jail
jobs they have no money they have the
housing and then we are
when they end up in jail
we must end the overcoat oscillation
violent young Americans who do not pose
a serious threat to our society it is an
international embarrassment that we have
more people in jail than any other
country it is obscenity that we
stigmatize so many young americans with
a criminal record for smoking marijuana
but not one major Wall Street exact it
has been prosecuted for causing the deal
collapse of our entire economy doesn't
make a whole lot of sense to me we need
to end prisons for profit I do not want
corporations making money and more money
based on how many people we lost off of
serious a defective warrant should not
be how many people go to jail but how
many people we can keep out of jail we
need to invest in drug court and medical
and mental health interventions mental
health what so many people in jail are
dealing with mental health issues that I
can tell you as a senator I get calls I
think others who was well senator my
brother I'm worried what he's going to
do it himself to other people we
searched desperately for affordable
mental health care we can't find it
that's going on all over america that is
a story that has to change
we have to take a hard look
and the tragedy last month in South
Carolina reminds me of that so strongly
that there are still those who seek to
terrorize and they all terrorists the
african-american community with violence
and intimidation some of us thought that
I had ended fifty years ago but it
hasn't we need to make sure that federal
resources are available to crack down on
the illegal activities of hate groups
there are hundreds of groups in this
country
sole reason for existence is hatred of
african-americans hatred of immigrants
hatred of Jews hatred of catholics that
has got to end of the federal government
must be active in ending that brothers
and sisters thank you very much for
allowing me to be with you and share
some ideas and let me conclude maybe in
the tone that I began
and that is very very difficult days no
question about it but I believe that if
we stand together as a people if we
don't let people divide us by race
gender sexual orientation by what
country we will if we stand together if
we have the courage to take on those
people today whose greed is destroying
America we do that there is nothing that
we cannot accomplish

like you
thank you to lose
and let me let me begin by saying that
we have done rallies all over this
country and we've had great people trade
unionist environmentalists women's
advocate introducing us but I have never
heard people young people
the kinds of introductions and
statements that hurt the night into Sun
and what it tells me and Raul Raul made
this point what it tells me is that when
we stand together as white black and
Latino and Native American and Asian
American when we stand together there is
nothing that can stop us from
transforming this country
and let me just thanking congressman
Raul Grijalva not only for his
friendship with so many years not only
for his coat chairmanship of the
Progressive Caucus by four but for his
decades of fighting for civil rights for
all of how much we all were the first
Americans and then we will protect them
that young man bob della Rosa and rugby
thank those who are young ladies Maria
Isabel Maria Teresa if we know that
wonderful rendition of the national
anthem frankly it is hard to follow in
the footsteps of these young people
beautiful young people make us all so
proud now I asked by the media
why it is that we are tracked turn out
like this why so many people in Tucson
around tonight by 24,000 people are out
in Boston last week
28,000 people couple of months ago were
out in portland oregon the media is
asking happening that we are raising
money without a super PAC
we were all told we were all closed all
of the political experts said that the
only way you can compete it's by picking
millionaires and billionaires and super
PACs for money we said no and our
campaign has received six hundred and
fifty thousand individual contributions
and the average contribution and there's
warms my heart the average contribution
is not two thousand it's not fifty
thousand it is $30 a person
this is not a billion
and when the media ask how is all of
this happening
who is going to respond to the call for
a political revolution it turns out that
the people in Tucson and people all over
this country are prepared to stand up to
Israel set and make sure and make sure
that our government belongs to all of us
and not just a handful of billion
that the american people are sick and
tired of establishment politics they are
sick and tired of establishment
economics the people of this country
understand that almost all of the new
wealth and income being created is going
to the top one percent
and the american people are saying loud
and clear we want an economy that works
for workers not the very rich
and the american people understand that
as a result of the Citizens United
Supreme Court decision you know about
citizens united that as a result of that
decision
our campaign finance system our
political system is totally corrupt and
american democracy is being under budget
before I get into the thrust of my
remarks I wanted to take a brief moment
to tell you what I expect most of you
already know and that is the today on
two campuses in our country one at Texas
Southern University student was shot and
killed and one was wounded and as you
know in your own state northern Arizona
State University in Plex left one
student was killed and three were
wounded now goes without saying it goes
without saying that our condolences go
to the families of those who were killed
in our hearts and prayers go out for a
full recovery but those that were
wounded but we also know that we are
tired of condolences and we are tired of
just press
we are tired and we are in Paris in
picking up the paper or turning on the
TV and seeing children in elementary
schools lauded and young people on
college campuses and the truth of the
matter is I wish I could tell you other
was the issue of gun violence is not
gonna be solved easily but just beat
callers it is not going to be solved
easily does not mean that we do not
address it and do the best we can
I can stay later Ramon like you and I
invite you all up early in the summer
and will come here in the website is
that I come from a slate which has a
history going back to its very creation
of people owning guns hunting doing
target practice but the truth and having
virtually no gun control at all today
but what the people of Vermont
understand is that we need to have a
serious conversation and stop the
yelling and the meaning of all people
involved in this issue
overwhelmingly the american people
understand that it is crazy that people
who should not all guns guns they are
all too well nearly that not only we do
we need to strengthen the instant
background check we need to broaden it
as well
and they understand that it makes no
sense that we have a loophole in the law
so that people can go to gun shows and
by weapons without having to go through
the instant background check people
understand that's wrong and I just got
to church and there are many people in
this country who do not why we are
selling and distributing allowing to be
distributed assault weapons which child
only one function and that is the
killing of people
and people do not understand why we do
not have legislation to prevent people
from buying guns legally what they sell
again to criminals was so close strong
min situation and also what people don't
understand is that in my state it all
over this country they are all people
who are experiencing severe emotional
problems all over this country we have
thousands of people who are suicidal or
homicidal what they cannot get the help
they need when they need it
a revolution in mental health delivery
in this country
somehow if you are involved in an
automobile accident in your hurt you get
rushed to an emergency rule and you get
good care people save you like but if
you are suffering a mental breakdown and
you are suicidal or homicidal you may
not be able to find the care you need
because there are doctors or counselors
available or you cannot afford that but
I think while yes there are
disagreements over how we go forward in
terms of gun safety I think the vast
majority of the american people want us
to goof ball in sensible way which keep
guns out of the hands of people who
should not have that a clutch down on
these senseless murders that we see
every week
and let me also say a word on an issue
that I know is obviously of enormous
consequence all over this country but
maybe more and Arizona than in many
other areas and that is the issue of
immigration reform and let me begin by
saying I know a little bit about
immigration my father came to this
country at the age of 17 from poland he
came to this country not speaking a word
of English came to this country without
a nickel in his pocket and he never made
a whole lot of money I grew up in a
three and a half
room rate controlled apartment in
Brooklyn New York and my mother's dream
was that someday maybe our family would
own home and not have to rent that never
happened she died young and her dream
never came to pass but my parents both
of them were enormously proud my father
may be especially to see his two sons go
to college and he enjoyed the
opportunities that america gave him in
there was no prouder American young man
who came to this country at the age of
my family's story is the story very
similar to many people who are here
tonight and that story is the story of
America it is the story of hard-working
families coming into this country to
create a brighter future for their
children
it is a story
rooted in family and fueled by hope it
is a story that continues to this day in
families all across our country today is
everyone here knows we have eleven
million people in this country who are
undocumented who came to this country to
improve their lives to escape oppression
fleeing desperate poverty and violence
let's be frank today's undocumented
workers play an extraordinarily
important role in our economy
where our workers it is likely that our
outlook cultural system would collapse
and dock workers are doing the hardest
work in this country they all our crops
building our homes cooking meals caring
for our kids they are
fabric of this country
11 million people came to this country
so they could feed their families
escape gang violence and desperate
economic circumstances
let me also be very clear that people
came to this country because they know
that there were jobs and if anyone
thinks that employers throughout america
didn't know that the workers they were
hiring undocumented they would walk
that is the reality of where we
employers were complicit hiring
undocumented workers for low wages
that's the fact of wages alright let me
tell you a little story if I might lack
in 2007 as the senator from vermont I
went to a place called Immokalee Florida
anybody know what is unique about
Immokalee Florida small town near Naples
that's where they grow postal the
tomatoes low-grade tomatoes used by
McDonald Burger King I went there on the
day that I visited just coincidentally
the USA eternity what's bringing charges
against a contract or for slavery in two
thousand and seven people were being
held in voluntarily to work in the
fields
and I saw their working conditions and
the exploitation that these workers
experience and I saw her rent does
housing that they lived in and i'm happy
to tell you that we are hearing on this
issue in washington we made some
progress wages went up working
conditions went off while there are many
Immokalee all over this country where
undocumented workers all be exploited
and when you explore the people who
cannot defend themselves when you
exploit people by paying low wages what
you are doing is creating a race to the
bottom for every worker in america
let me tell you something else people
can have disagreements about immigration
reform but in the year 2015 it is not
acceptable
stooping to racism and demagoguery in
order to win some political goals
it is not acceptable
it is american should be defining a
whole group of people come from Mexico
and calling them criminals and Rick
warehouse for so hard in this country
for hundreds of years to end racism
discrimination in 2015 to that kind of
ugly language
in two thousand and thirteen I proudly
supported comprehensive immigration
reform legislation that passed the USS
said it now this is not what I do not
the provisions of the DREAM Act which
strongly support and which would offer
the opportunity of permanent residency
and eventual citizenship to young people
who are brought to the United States as
children by believe that we should
recognize the young men and women who
comprise the dream is for what they are
american kids who deserve the right to
legally be in the country where chance
that home
Senate bill was far from perfect but at
least it began the process of moving us
in the right direction it is beyond my
comprehension that the House of
Representatives has not yet even be the
discussion on immigration it's hurting a
racism maybe they want to deal with this
issue in a serious way we can't pass
comprehensive immigration reform we must
be as aggressive as we can in pursuing
policies that are you made and sensible
and that keep families together
and this includes taking measures that
are currently available including using
the presidential power of executive
orders when appropriate
while the Senate passed the DREAM Act in
its immigration bill and while the house
has not yet acted I think President
Obama did exactly the right thing there
is executive Lloyd but deferred action
for childhood arrivals daca disclosed
was a good first step but should be
expanded deferred action should be
expanded to include the parents of
citizens parents of legal permanent
residence and the parents of drinkers
our job is to families together not tear
them apart when we talk about issues
facing this country be ongoing violence
beyond immigration we are talking about
the fact that in the United States today
we have boy income and wealth inequality
than any other major country on earth
and it is worse today in America than at
any time since 1928 let me be very clear
there is something profoundly wrong in
this country when the top one tenth of
one percent all almost as much well as
the bottom 90%
that is not what America is supposed to
be about there is something profoundly
wrong went in our results are in Vermont
and all over this country people are
working three jobs people are working
incredible hours in order to put food on
the table and yet 58% of old new income
is going to the top one percent that's
look there is something wrong in this
country went in recent years we have
seen a proliferation of millions and
billions as yet we have the highest rate
of childhood poverty of any major
country are there is something wrong
when in the last two years the 14
wealthiest people in this country
fourteen people have seen their wealth
increase by a hundred and fifty six
billion dollars
well that is sold by the bottom 130
million americans what this campaign is
about sending a message to the
billionaire class and that message is
you cannot have it all
to the greedy is that you get more tax
breaks
children in america go hungry
you are not going to provide
compensation packages to the CEOs of
large corporations at the same time
cutting the health care and the wages
and pensions workers
not just the grotesque level of income
and wealth inequality it is about the
fact that yes we are a lot better off
economically today than we were when
bush left office that's true you know my
Republican friends suffer from the
disease
short term amnesia oil their views the
Barack Obama's closed every problem in
the history of the world yet they took
seven years ago
800,000 people of monks were losing
their jobs they seem to have forgotten
that the world's financial system as a
result of the greed and recklessness on
Wall Street was on the verge of collapse
and they seem to forget great deficit
hawks that they were in the bush we ran
up the largest deficit in the history of
america
but while we are better off today than
we were seven years ago there is no the
truth and that is for the last forty
years the great middle class of this
country has been disappearing what we
have seen in recent years an explosion
of technology workers big fall more
productive as yet most of all people are
working longer hours for low wages what
we have seen is median family income in
this country going down by four thousand
dollars since 1999 what we have seen is
male workers the average male worker the
middle of the economy making hundreds of
dollars less than he did forty years ago
in women making less today than they did
seven years ago
what political revolution that we are
involved is about yet we are going to
create an economy that works for all of
us and not just the people on top
lot talked about enough real
unemployment in this country if you
include those people have given up
looking for work in the media or working
part-time 85 percent it is 10% and now
let me tell you something that very few
people talk about and I did the crisis
of youth unemployment in this country
couple of months ago I asked some
economist to do a study for me and I
asked them to tell me what real youth
unemployment and underemployment was for
high school graduates not dropouts high
school graduates between the ages of 17
and 20 and this is what they told me for
white kids real unemployment 33% or
Latino kids real unemployment 36% for
African American kids real unemployment
51%
you know the words we are turning our
backs on a generation of young people
who want to stand up on their own two
feet they want to earn some money they
want to get out of the house they want
to begin their lives as adults and what
we are saying to them there are no jobs
available for you but let me tell you
something else that we are saying to
these young people today in America we
have more people in jail than any other
country on earth . million people in
jail
disproportionately black and Latino now
it seems to me when you have youth
unemployment at thirty forty or fifty
percent maybe just maybe it makes sense
to invest in education and jobs
there is a promise is a promise I don't
make a whole lot of campaign promises
you got one here tonight if elected
president the United States of America
will not have more people in jail than
any other country
where send our young people to jobs and
school not
and when we talk about the economy in
america today and when we talk about
white people working such long hours so
many jobs it has everything to do with
the fact that wages in America are just
too low as all of you know the federal
minimum wage is $7.25 an hour
the arithmetic as well as I kept you
about the boy suffered a quarter or $8
like 40 hours a week 52 weeks a year and
what you end up with is not enough money
to take care of a family
and that is why I believe that the
minimum wage has got to be raised to a
living wage
and what we talked about fair wages I
hope every man here will stand with the
women and fight but pay equity for women
workers
there is no rational economic reason why
women are earning 79 cents on the dollar
compared to ban it is simply sexism it's
got it
now in the in the campaign season we
often hear a whole lot about family
values republican family values about
families by you all know that when
republicans talk about family values
what they are talking about is their
belief that women in this country should
not have the right to control their own
bodies I disagree
about family values what they are
talking about is that our gay brothers
and sisters should not have the right to
get married
my wife Jane just been and I have been
married for 27 years we have four great
kids and seven beautiful grandchildren
we believe in family values but they're
not republican family values
at the top of my list of family values
for the United States to end the
international embarrassment of being the
only nature country on earth that does
not guarantee paid family medical leave
when a working-class woman has a baby
she should not be forced to go back to
work a week or two weeks after the birth
of that baby and that its while I
believe that our country has got to join
the rest of the industrialized world and
guarantee at least three months
up a family of medically brothers and
sisters when we talk about the economy
what is always on people's minds is the
issue of jobs jobs jobs people on
dissent how difficult it is to go out
and get a job that pays a living wage
well it seems to me that have real
unemployment is 10% if you thought
employment is thirty forty or fifty
percent the United States government
must undertake a massive federal jobs
program to put millions of people back
door
I want to see this country hiring
teachers not firing
I want to cities and towns higher II
trial care workers so that our kids get
the quality child care they need
and went our infrastructure our roads
our bridges water systems rail airports
levees and dams are collapsing all over
this country I want to see millions of
workers getting back to work rebuilding
and when we talk about the economy we
cannot help but talk about the greed and
fraud and dishonesty and arrogance of
those who work on Wall Street all of you
know that as a result of the greed and
recklessness and illegal behavior of
Wall Street this country was driven into
the worst economic downturn since the
nineteen thirties what some of you may
not know you may not know this but today
fool largest banks are much larger today
than they were when we bailed them out
because they were too big to fail
when we have six banks in this country
are showing two-thirds of the credit
cards and over 35% of all mortgages in
my view when you have a six large banks
that have a six equivalent to 60 percent
of the GDP of this country when you have
banks that are too big to fail in my
view they are too big to exist
we've got a break them up
I want to see financial system where
credit unions and community banks are
out there making loans to small and
medium-sized businesses not all wall
street which long island unto itself
overly concerned about their profits
brothers and sisters when we talk about
what's going on in this country today
there is one issue which impacts every
of the issue and that is five years ago
5240 the United States Supreme Court
rules through citizens united that
billions and billions as would be able
to purchase the United States government
what they say what is to the wealthiest
people in this country that said you
guys already own
much of the economy we are now gonna
give you the opportunity to own the
government and the result of that is the
wealthiest people in this country are
pouring huge amounts of money into
campaigns in order to elect candidates
whose sole function in life is to
represent the rich and the powerful
one family in America but second
wealthiest families the Koch brothers
you got this family and what they wanted
to cut social security they want to
eliminate Social Security Letter want to
cut medicare eliminate Medicare and
Medicaid and the Environmental
Protection Agency they don't want to
simply not raise the minimum wage they
want to do with the concept of the
minimum wage so workers can work with
300 bucks and I'll
this family is going to spend some 900
million dollars in this election cycle
in other words what democracy has become
one vote they have one vote plus nine
hundred billion dollars now when you how
one family spending more money on a
campaign the life of a democratic party
or the republican party you are not
talkin about democracy you are talking
about and we got good stuff
here is my second promise to you tonight
and that is that no nominee of mind to
the USS Supreme Court will get that
position unless he or she is loud and
clear
telling the american people that they
will vote to overturn Citizens United
by the way when we talk about democracy
and we talked about the fact that brave
men and women throughout our history
have fought and died to defend democracy
it is important to say a word about
those republican governors and
legislators who are trying to suppress
the vote all over this country that i've
been involved in a lot of election
sometimes I've lost sometimes I have one
but it is never occurred to me to figure
out a way to deny the vote to people who
disagree with me and would vote against
me I regard it as an act of political
cowardice colors for people to not have
the guts to go out in a free and fair
election the think the only way they can
win islamic horrible low-income people
young people people of color to vote and
my suggestion to those people if you are
afraid of a fair election get another
job
anything to say about it and I will if
elected president there will be one law
fifty states in his country and that is
if you're eighteen years of age you are
registered dogs out
when we talk about democracy let me tell
you what I wanna see all want to see
this country one of the highest voting
turnout of any country not one of the
lowest voter turnouts and I want to see
anybody here tonight regardless of their
political views if you wanna run for
office i want you to be able to run for
office without having to big campaign
contributions from wealthy people and
that is why I support public funding of
elections
and let me touch on another issue of
enormous consequence we live as all of
you know in a highly competitive global
economy and if we are going to seek see
now and in the future we need the best
educated workforce in the world that
means that means that with Mom and Dad
go to work they know that their kids are
in high-quality pre-k programs that they
can afford it
public school teachers are adequately
funded
and this is what it also sees it in
american we've got legislation it to do
this every public college and university
must be
it is hopefully think about it for a
second we have hundreds of thousands of
bright young people in this country they
are qualified they're ready to go to
college they can't go for one reason
their families lack the money what we
are doing is pulling out the latter form
right underneath them give them the
opportunity to make it into the middle
class to become teachers or doctors or
engineers or scientists that is unfair
to those young people but it is unfair
to the future of this country our job
is the capture the best intellect so
that we can to say to young people you
can't get the education because your
families lack the money is totally
absurd totally absurd and what we are
also gonna deal with is the absurd
situation today
of millions of young people and people
not so young who are struggling with
high levels of student debt now I spoke
two years ago I spoke to young woman in
burlington vermont her dream was to go
to medical school become a primary care
physician for low-income people exactly
what we need our penalty for doing what
this country desperately needs was
coming out of school
$300,000 it does
all over this country there is a
Deadpool crisis we need deadliest we
need to make sure that people can afford
to go to get this that they could access
to access that came out of school
$400,000 a debt all over this country
people are graduating school deeply in
debt that take twenty twenty-five
percent of their incomes on student debt
now what i don't understand when we talk
about student that how does it happen
that people are Scott with student that
interest rates of 68 10 percent when you
could refinance your home the 23 for the
site so our legislation will allow
people to refinance at the lowest
interest rates they could find it will
get the government out of the business
of profiteering lot of working-class
families
now people so well so great idea burning
but it is expensive their right it is
expensive
going to cost about 70 billion a year
you know we're gonna pay for it
attacks on Wall Street speculation
when Wall Street collapsed in 2008 they
came back the taxpayers of this country
oh please bill of sale will be good boys
well now it's wall street's turn to bail
out the middle class
and when we talk about our
responsibilities as human beings and his
parents there is nothing more important
than leaving our planet healthily and
habitable for our kids and our
grandchildren Pope Francis is rights
debate is over the scientific community
is virtually unanimous climate change is
real it is close by human activity and
it is already causing devastating
problems throughout our country and much
of the world we have a moral
responsibility to lead the world to work
with China and Russia and India
countries all over this world is
transforming our energy system away from
fossil fuel
so energy efficiency and sustainable
energy
and when we talk about needs of the
american people of where we want to go
as a donation I hope that every person
here knows that there is only one major
wealthy nation on earth that does not
guarantee health care to all people as a
right that is the United States of
America that is going to change the
Affordable Care Act has done a lot of
good I was proud to support it but we
have got to go further
29 million people still have no health
insurance and many more are underinsured
with high premiums and high deductibles
in my view we have got to move toward a
Medicare for All single-payer program
health care is a right of all people not
a privilege
and when we talk about where we want to
go as a nation we have got to understand
the world we oppose a long way in
overcoming discrimination and racism and
prejudice sadly and tragically racism
remains alive and well in america and I
promise you my third promise there will
be no president who will fight hard to
end institutional racism in this country
and reform a broken criminal justice
system
the first point maybe the most important
point is that no president not Bernie
Sanders anybody else can address the
enormous problems that we face in this
country and I touched on some of them so
enormous problems no president can do
you know why let me tell you what no
other candidate with the powers that be
in this country that is corporate
america Wall Street corporate media the
large campaign donors they are so
powerful that no president of loan can
effectively take them on and bring about
the changes that we need in this country
to add room lives working people the
only way that real change takes place is
when we make it political revolution in
which millions of people in all black in
white and Latino and Native American and
Asian American gays and straights then
and women people who were born in this
country people who were born in other
countries now what politics in america
is about touched on this is our
opponents are trying to divide us they
are trying to divide those who are born
in this country from those who weren't
there trying to divide straight people
from gay people men or women and I were
antidote is to say that I know you not
deployed we are going to stay together
and we are gonna say yes your when your
super PACs may have all the body but we
have something you don't have and what
we have a look around you can I we are
the people
and a simple political fact and this is
just a fact of history is that when
people stand together in demand change
we never lose we never lose think about
it for a moment
think about it think about the civil
rights struggle of millions of people
coming together saying we're gonna and
racism in America think about women
coming together and say we're not going
to be second class citizens and think
about the environmental community coming
together and see your address the
environmental crises that we face think
about the progress made in recent years
led by the gay community in their
straight allies
when we stand together and we say you
know we're gonna create an economy that
just just doesn't make the rich richer
but it's gonna give dignity and security
to the elderly because we are not going
to cut social security we're going to
expand social security now my message
than I is please do not think small the
big you are living now we could have if
we were poor country we could have a we
would have a very different type of
discussion if you're a poor country that
people would have to say it's too bad we
can't afford to send their kids to
college we can't afford health care
people brothers and sisters you were
living today
in the wealthiest country in the history
of the world which very few people
understand that because almost all of
the well is going to the people on the
top
utopian thinking to say that when we
think big and when we stand together we
can create a situation where every man
woman and child in this country has
health care as a right not your clothes
thinkin it existed every other major
country it is not utopian thinking to
say that we can have the best childcare
and pre-k system in the world
it is thought utopian thinking because
many other countries already do it to
say that caller public colleges and
universities should be tuition-free not
utopia it is not utopia to say that the
veterans the men and women who put their
lives on the line to defend this should
get their health care and the benefits
that they are not utopia
utopian to say that every person in this
country no matter their race their
religion their disability their sexual
orientation should be able to realize
the full promise of equality that

not charged
child
I would
country
60 workers
what people say the issue
it is
going
global

beautiful introductions and thank you
Charleston for their stern
and let me tell you you are a proud
taken a huge relief
to the boys and what the point is is
this campaign is about bringing people
together
because when we bring the middle-class
and working-class together when we bring
white and black and Hispanic Native
American men and women trading ok now
you look for
where we can't stop us from transforming
the country
the american people are beginning to
catch on to what's going on in this
country
sick and tired of establishment politics
tired of establishment economics and
with the establishment media
the people of this country on the stand
one fundamental point and that his
corporate greed in america
that it is immoral that is unsustainable
good almost all of the new wealth
generated in this country is going to
the top one percent and you were taught
together I gotta change that
understand that we have a corrupt
political system went billion are able
to buy politicians will joke
and what we know what the candidate will
say and that is we cannot bring about
the kind of changes that we need in this
country there is a political revolution
and what clearly is that this great
country of ours belongs to all of us not
just a handful of billionaires
but Americans and the reason they don't
understand the reason they don't feel it
is that almost all well and all of that
income is going to be a few together is
to create an economy that works for
working families not just the people on
trial
very very rich and everyone else that in
any time since the nineteen twenties the
issue of wealth and income inequality is
the great moral issue of our time the
great economic you're sure the great
political
together we are going
when the top one tenth of one percent 1
of 1 percent almost as much well as the
bottom 90%
there is something profoundly wrong when
we have seen in recent years the
proliferation of millionaires and
billionaires while the average American
Fork slog around was for low wages and
we have the highest rate of childhood
poverty of any major country
there is something profoundly wrong when
one of the Walton family owns well forty
percent of the American people
enough
and it's contrary this campaign and the
people of america are sending a message
and that message is simple you cannot
continue
you are not going to continue to get
huge tax regs when children in america
go hungry
corporate America and the billion not
gonna continue to send out jobs to China
and other countries when millions here
that's really good paying jobs are not
going to put their billions in profit in
the Cayman Islands to avoid paying their
fair share of taxes
we are saying loudly and clearly is
corporate greed and we are going to end
it
income and wealth inequality not only
impact every state in america my state
of Vermont let me tell you how it
impacts in South Carolina and the last
two years if you can believe it ought
wealthiest people in this country
whattt not a lot of people there well
increase by a hundred and fifty six
billion dollars
while the billion become much much
richer 27 percent of the children here
in South Carolina are living in poverty
what's million children in America and
its South Carolina
those children 11 and poverty $138,000
black 95,000 all-white 30,000 this
across the board and impacts every race
and together we are ashamed of having
the highest child poverty rate
no country which is great
turns its back on children no country
proud country leaves kids childcare
without these housing and when we talk
about basic rights about the needs of
everyone is human beings let us talk
about health care
that the United States is the only
country to all people
why I believe medicare program
insurance companies and the drug
companies and the big money interests
like what their day is going to come
uninsured population almost in half the
number of from 20 percent to 12 percent
a small box and South Carolina
health insurance and legislature of this
as provided for in the Affordable Care
Act
health care in this country
last month I asked I asked them and kids
who are high school graduates between
the ages of 17 and 20 and what their
unemployment and underemployment rates
were
this is what they found if the kids were
white high school graduates 70 20 33
percent of them were unemployed if they
were 36% 51%
more than any other country on her
china is a country much much larger than
china is a communist authoritarian
country pretty tough stuff we have more
people in jail and let me tell you if
anybody believe that there is a direct
connection between five and a half
million people in this country who have
no jobs and school if you think there is
not a connection between that reality
and the fact that so many people are in
jail you would be sorely mistaken
as president building more jails instead
of locking more people
$7
and when we talk let me ask all of the
men who are here tonight just stand with
women and fight
have been married for 27
my Republican colleagues
of America
unforgettable when your baby comes in
the world and is a pretty big day for
the baby as well and democracy in South
Carolina if that woman that family have
decent incomes mom can stay home
weeks and months and long and nourish
the most important time
box if mom's family does not have
sufficient you know what happens that
baby is separated from because her mom
has to go back to work in five days or
ten days
and that is why I will fight to make
sure that every family in America gets
three months of pay
and we are also gonna of America being
the only major country on earth does not
provide pay guarantees will pay
unemployment in america is all but 10
percent of youth unemployment is thirty
forty fifty percent it is clear to me
that the United States government wants
to be a major jobs program to put our
people back to work
South Carolina State of Vermont all over
america our infrastructure our roads our
bridges our rail system water plants
wastewater infrastructure is crumbling I
have proposed a trillion dollar
investment let us rebuild our
infrastructure put
when we talk about jobs create millions
of jobs we must the loss of millions of
jobs to trade policies trade policies so
how has all of america you are looking
at the United States congressman who
voted against not permanent normal trade
position
corporate america wants to buy their
products wants us to purchase products
airtight I'm not a child
what is the most important is impossible
to one issue that impacts every five
years ago as most of you know by a
five-to-four decision the Supreme Court
of the United States
poorly with the Citizens United case
and what they said people in America you
already own much of america
the economy opportunity to purchase the
United States and that here's what they
are trying to do right now
American political system today as a
result of Citizens United has been
totally corrupted and the foundations of
American democracy are being american
democracy is not supposed to be about
buying elections and buying american
democracy is supposed to be one person
one vote
many campaign promises to you right now
and that is any of mine to the United
States Supreme Court will make it loud
and clear that he or she will vote to
overturn
in the world
democracy and when we talk about one
person
fifty years ago congress passed the
president johnson's full voting rights
act and what the Voting Rights Act
finally here's that every american has
the right to vote regardless of the
color of his or her skin
got one of the most important provisions
of the Voting Rights out and literally
supreme court based its decision
republican governors and attorney
generals and legislators began to go to
work to figure out how they could deny
poor people and people of color and old
people the right to vote
you know I have been involved in many
campaigns in my state of Vermont Ave Los
51 many are curved Jimmy never once
tried to figure out a way to deny my
opponents I believe
win elections based on the strength of
your ideas not by keeping
I have been introduced which will go a
long way to make one very simple point
and america if you are a team you
registered to vote
people who have do not have the guts to
campaign on their ideas people who think
the only way they can win not to vote
these people political cowards they
should get another job
that in america today we are living in a
very highly competitive global economy
and of our economy is the succeed in the
future we need the best in the world are
you human tragedy that today hundreds of
thousands of bright young people kids
well done well in school kids who are
qualified to get a higher education on
not able to go to college for one reason
and one reason alone and that is their
families lack the money
that is not what america it is unfair to
those young people who want to become
doctors they want a rise out of poverty
to make it into the middle class and
we're pullin
but it is even if we talk about the
future of America well we need all of
the bright people we can make our
economy strong growth
I have introduced legislation and we'll
make it happen if elected president to
make every college and university in
America through which three
financial today
like my family
their parents never went to college they
don't know anybody who went to college
the idea of going to college is beyond
their wildest I want those kids to know
that if they do their homework if they
take school seriously they will be able
to go to college
regardless
levels of school
and here's the crazy there are people
with food and debt paying interest rates
of 68 10 percent when you can refinance
your home
three or four percent
people to refinance at lower interest
rates
of profiteering
profit from working-class families who
simply wanted to send the college
when we talk about our responsibilities
as human beings as parents as adults
there is nothing more than I can then
making certain that we leave this planet
to our children and grandchildren in a
way that is habitable
scientific community is virtually
unanimous climate change is real climate
change is caused by human activity and
climate change is already causing
problems in our country and around the
world
years we have a small window of
opportunity basically a few use to get
our act together to transform our energy
system or else by the end of this
century the planet earth will be five to
10 degrees warmer more trials drought
flood were extreme weather disturbances
more acidification of the ocean more
rising sea levels and the CIA tells us
more conflict around the world as people
fight over a limited natural resources
we have a moral responsibility to work
with China and Russia and India to lead
the world and moving away from fossil
fuel energy efficiency and sustainable
ranking member Leader of the Opposition
on the democratic side on the budget
committee about national priorities and
about values I want you to know that a
number of months ago the republicans
passed a budget in the congress they
control the house and the Senate and
this is what their budget and I want
everybody including working class people
who vote Republican to know what was
what was in that budget is repeal of the
Affordable Care Act massive cuts in
medicaid the result 27 million more
Americans lose health insurance
republicans what happens when 27 how
many of them how many of them
trying to put food on the table
they found but I'm 250 billion dollars
in tax breaks to one person
was a greedy multi-million working-class
and middle-class Republican support
our job this campaign may be the most
important thing we can do is to get
people in america working people middle
class people low-income people voting
wanna make cuts veterans programs
are we not gonna
also that when men and women country we
are not gonna cut veterans' benefits
and when we talk about our country what
kind of country we know that it can be
we must be very clear that we are going
to end
institutional racism and we are going to
transform
and we all going to trans and make
radical changes in a criminal justice
system that is broken
the good news in terms of combating
racism over the last many many decades
not far enough but if we were sitting
here thirty years ago and somebody said
well you know I think in 2008 people of
the United States overcame hundreds of
years of racism and we will be
collecting an african-american is
president of the united states nobody
would have believed that but in fact
2008 the American people look beyond the
color of a candidate's can look at his
ideas and voted for Obama
of american society no one can deny I am
not just talking about the sixth of a
man walking to class 4a where people
take out a gun and kill nine people that
is literally impossible to comprehend
and I'm not just talking about the
hundreds of hate groups that exists only
function they are only function of
african-americans immigrants or gays or
juice can you imagine a group whose only
functional but in addition to clear them
talking about racism we are talking
about sound for bland Michael Brown
about Eric gone are we talking about
Walter Scott pretty grey and many are we
do not know died unnecessarily and
wrongly at the hands of police offices
or in police custody must change
nobody will raise our broken
things to be done in order to the
community
people trust
a whole lot of police officers in my
community and if anybody hear things
today is an easy job you're wrong and
the vast majority of police offices
tried to do the best they can honestly
and protecting the people but
by the way many of these police officers
are underpaid they have crazy schedules
and live under enormous stress what
police official breaks that police
officer must be held accountable
new rules regarding the use of force to
break up crowds to prevent violence and
what good police officers do that with
us and lethal force should be the last
thing
americans are in jail for non violent
crimes we need to rethink the war on
drugs
I really remarkable young person's
criminal record but the crux on wall
street who destroyed our economy
lot of people around the country have
been talking about and I agree with and
when congress reconvenes in September
introduced legislation and that is to
end the absurdity of private
corporations making profits by running
jails and building
people further addiction drug addiction
are illnesses that need to be treated
drug courts and medical and mental
health intervention
are providing and they serve time and
they got out of jail and they have no
education they have no jobs no money no
housing
associate with exactly the same people
that got him in jail and all end up back
in jail
point of view and it makes no sense from
a financial point of view it costs more
money to put people in jail to the
University of South Carolina
all of you are aware that we live in a
nation in which a handful of very very
wealthy people have extraordinary power
over our economy and our political life
and that's the reality they are very
very powerful and many of them are
extremely greedy I will never understand
how families like the Koch brothers work
a deal worth 85 billion dollars
apparently think they need more and more
and they're willing to the children the
elderly the sick and the poor in order
to become even richer I will never
understand that kind of green
yes yes but there is something that they
don't have we have the people and when
we stand together
in the wealthiest country in the history
of the world do not
create
country mom and dad go to work they know
that their child care in the world in
which all of our people get a college
education
weekend the most vulnerable people
including our seniors seniors choose
between medicine and food
and what's and women who put their lives
on the line to defend us get the health
care and all of the benefits that they
deserve
we can live in which everyone no matter
their race religion no matter their
disability no matter their sexual
orientation
realizes full potential of what America
is about equality for all
the day after the election
sexual orientation
