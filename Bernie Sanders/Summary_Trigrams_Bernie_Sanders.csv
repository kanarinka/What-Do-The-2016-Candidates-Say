what that means,12
the great middle,12

to participate in,10
78 cents on,10

to the supreme,10
we make it,10
is exactly what,10
up to me,10
the federal reserve,10
america is supposed,10
in many cases,10
last thirty years,10
we must be,10
going to raise,10
have a super,10
much wealth as,10
to try to,10
and i hope,10
country and i,10
going to end,10
people and that,10
living in the,10
all know that,10
percent interest rates,10
came up to,10
believe that we,10
mayor of burlington,10
be held accountable,10
unanimous climate change,10
it is unsustainable,10
not one of,10
be shocked to,10
the bottom of,10
our time and,10
american democracy and,10
up and tell,10
well we have,10
last two years,10

bright young people,10
of almost any,10
promise to you,10

that you have,10
something that is,10
they were too,10
that if you,10
it and i,10
people of any,10
recent years we,10
cayman islands and,10
huge increase in,10
who do not,10
know that the,10
the nineteen thirties,10
this country not,10
about that is,10
there are many,10
history of our,10
our responsibilities as,10
it is an,10
states government and,10
time real unemployment,10
what democracy is,10
many thousands of,10
a baseball game,10
half of the,10
jobs program to,10
is that no,10
you already own,10
should be about,10
is what the,10
a great idea,10
over climate change,10
no matter what,10
many people who,10
member of the,10
not fair when,10
class and working,10
permanent normal trade,10
being the only,10
nations in the,10
i don't want,10
establishment politics and,10
up and fight,10
and the billionaire,10
across this country,10
and we will,10
this country as,10
seen a proliferation,10
millions of our,10
involved in the,10
that means is,10
i have to,10
thousand dollars a,10
able to control,10
that the government,10
get away with,10
there was a,10
say you know,10
to the political,10
the war in,10
here in new,10
a half million,10
is a right,10
to put their,10
part time when,10
which we have,10
three times more,10
to overturn citizens,10
almost twice as,10
not just in,10
know and that,10
we must address,10
let me conclude,10
let me take,10
to break up,10
working families in,10
talk about jobs,10
bring about the,10
we are also,10
government of our,10
need the best,10
for a moment,10
seven years ago,10
goes without saying,10
let me say,10
our backs on,10
people understand that,10
if they are,10
in transforming our,10
than they were,10
in a democratic,10
what it will,10
bottom line is,10
the gdp of,10
united states must,10
of millionaires and,10
up in jail,10
this country have,10
citizens united decision,10
in the country,10
those people who,10
our time it,10
as president of,10
when bush left,10
more rising sea,10
of their people,10
so what we,10
change is already,10
what the supreme,10
bailed them out,10
why i will,10
not have a,10
people have given,10
you can believe,10
in which the,10
is to create,10
own much of,10
responsibility to work,10
works for working,10
piece of paper,10
paying jobs and,10
and what that,10
and it was,10
don't have a,10
wealth as the,10
i was able,10
the american middle,10
living wage 15,10
unemployment in this,10
do that we,10
in poverty and,10
but this is,10
is a starvation,10
most of the,10
the fight against,10
world we have,10
wall street and,10
the world but,10
downturn since the,10
and there are,10
we can and,10
we had a,10
their families lack,10
have to be,10
all over our,10
out and get,10
every man woman,10
and we can,10
know in a,10
an issue that,10
got to end,10
major issues facing,10
proliferation of millionaires,10
about it and,10
former chairman of,10
able to go,10
the greed and,10
vote to overturn,10
and we were,10
know i think,10
trying to cobble,10

this country they,10
one third of,10

but we have,10
and if you,10
talk about family,10

that if we,8

proud to tell,8
the political revolution,8
and thirty million,8
and the foundations,8

every child in,8
to tell me,8
a decent job,8
bank of america,8
this opportunity to,8
and the largest,8
going to college,8
the federal level,8
it is my,8
result of citizens,8
relations with china,8
do not believe,8
many other countries,8
we don't talk,8
by saying this,8
so that people,8
in jails and,8
do with the,8
that so many,8
how many people,8
you guys already,8
path toward citizenship,8
can't go to,8
unless he or,8
our republican friends,8
of a few,8
of the major,8
by far the,8
in a small,8
one reason and,8
not be living,8
to college but,8
of this century,8
that is more,8
we must create,8
i was not,8
we are tired,8
say to the,8
which we are,8
got to understand,8
to energy efficiency,8
what they need,8
drop out of,8
in education and,8
acceptable to me,8
gay brothers and,8
over our country,8
will continue to,8
wall street to,8
who are undocumented,8
will in fact,8
and i do,8
forty or fifty,8
our people and,8
about the changes,8
now we're going,8
millions of young,8
working families not,8
care act has,8
by the end,8
you all know,8
want us to,8
our act together,8
a democratic society,8
control her own,8
we have in,8
the average contribution,8
that every person,8
ages of 17,8
political revolution in,8
must not be,8
kids real unemployment,8
an african american,8
totally corrupted and,8
we're trying to,8
americans are working,8
you tell me,8
more than i,8
will make the,8
they are working,8
lost their life,8
you to think,8
but i will,8
that people are,8
family values what,8
rather than jails,8
two thousand and,8
social security benefits,8
we bailed them,8
because when we,8
little bit different,8
every major country,8
any candidate in,8
than it was,8
wall street corporate,8
is the fact,8
not democracy that,8
too many people,8
either the democratic,8
of vermont and,8
work longer hours,8
that we will,8
only for his,8
back into the,8
it is to,8
this country should,8
close to 11,8
are hundreds of,8
i do believe,8
the time for,8
when we need,8
that in america,8
of working class,8
america and the,8
moral issue of,8
going to substantially,8
you have to,8
of the federal,8
have been married,8
truly free when,8
would like to,8
the needs of,8
of 17 and,8
since the nineteen,8
was born in,8
is an issue,8
of millions and,8
say that is,8
the real issues,8
late for establishment,8
the trans pacific,8
of the community,8
bailed out wall,8
millions of workers,8
and illegal behavior,8
applause my friends,8
me give you,8
that is healthy,8
largest city in,8
their lives to,8
the illegal behavior,8
a proliferation of,8
in america are,8
bringing people together,8
contributions than any,8
and here is,8
million americans this,8
and the illegal,8
to be that,8
should be able,8
family income is,8
and clearly that,8
born in america,8
get that position,8
people lost their,8
having more people,8
republican governors and,8
i believe in,8
they will in,8
they understand that,8
five and a,8
two hundred billion,8
message to the,8
we are the,8
as well and,8
stated and i,8
sense to me,8
the good news,8
that's not what,8
know that there,8
when we come,8
jobs trying to,8
infrastructure our roads,8
to rebuild our,8
for young people,8
thousands of dollars,8
a tax break,8
out of high,8
disastrous citizens united,8
make it to,8
kids in this,8
we're gonna be,8
his or her,8
we still have,8
the reason they,8
throughout this country,8
economic establishment of,8
the most powerful,8
we all understand,8
full time real,8
middle class family,8
it has been,8
seven million people,8
grew up in,8
we want your,8
there is one,8
what i mean,8
in the first,8
thirty million americans,8
are having a,8
we must work,8
go hungry you,8
our infrastructure our,8
income inequality is,8
you study hard,8
low wages and,8
they know that,8
you may know,8
the gap between,8
to the university,8
now we are,8
bottom of my,8
you are looking,8
this nation but,8
will need to,8
and the gap,8
to come together,8
do that and,8
to vote and,8
if we stand,8
more money than,8
activity and it,8
and economic establishment,8
to come up,8
than we were,8
are in jail,8
get police records,8
is creating a,8
they stood up,8
you can't get,8
going to take,8
makes no sense,8
do a lot,8
together in a,8
the new wealth,8
that i have,8
underinsured with large,8
is what this,8
the bottom half,8
defend this nation,8
once the envy,8
issues facing this,8
are looking at,8
some of you,8
don't talk about,8
in the hands,8
individual contributions than,8
second class citizens,8
is over climate,8
everybody else gets,8
political revolution is,8
i see a,8
not only for,8
you what you,8
industrialized world and,8
makes sense to,8
court will get,8
truth of the,8
jails and incarceration,8
to college for,8
people are in,8
of you may,8
way to go,8
it clear that,8
jobs to china,8
of citizens united,8
it is absolutely,8
them out because,8
going to provide,8
country once the,8
for the rich,8
what america is,8
we must not,8
breaks for billionaires,8
and mental health,8
thank all of,8
the last many,8
great depression and,8
african american and,8
get our act,8
is their families,8
and all of,8
it is caused,8
give you a,8
people on top,8
is a political,8
if they do,8
and many other,8
kids and seven,8
that health care,8
we say to,8
no president not,8
don't want to,8
their wealth increase,8
we can have,8
know that because,8
they are all,8
stand up to,8
have more income,8
as likely to,8
that we all,8
than any time,8
the young people,8
world to transform,8
people with disabilities,8
the budget committee,8
not only the,8
to make every,8
in the road,8
the income of,8
that he or,8
to work in,8
massive cuts in,8
a long way,8
me just say,8
the financial crisis,8
when one family,8
is unfair to,8
hope all of,8
just talking about,8
that i can,8
fact that in,8
the rich and,8
i can tell,8
twice as much,8
people should not,8
not truly free,8
three months of,8
not what america,8
make every public,8
old same old,8
out wall street,8
rates on student,8
years the great,8
out on street,8
and sisters should,8
we are living,8
to you that,8
a few months,8
something that i,8
lower interest rates,8
a word about,8
martin luther king,8
had no money,8
and then we,8
to those who,8
on some of,8
middle class to,8
depression of the,8
get a decent,8
are not truly,8
make it easier,8
and i believe,8
compared to men,8
very clear and,8
of america today,8
the people who,8
handful of billion,8
born in this,8
goes on in,8
real unemployment in,8
big to jail,8
we have hundreds,8
in burlington vermont,8
to address the,8
get the best,8
in american history,8
lost their homes,8
and when the,8
the grotesque level,8
young men and,8
trade relations with,8
the vast majority,8
these young people,8
and in my,8
house and the,8
is that is,8
america it is,8
roads our bridges,8
and one of,8
matter their race,8
the truth of,8
criminal justice reform,8
of my heart,8
afford to go,8
this point in,8
as of today,8
about the fact,8
in this is,8
between the ages,8
department of justice,8
tax on wall,8
stay home with,8
they will be,8
without having to,8
families not just,8
out of that,8
the changes that,8
they do their,8
do you know,8

and everybody else,8
despite exploding technology,8
not so young,8
system in the,8
you have some,8
out by the,8
the rate of,8
we believe in,8
of them are,8
political and economic,8
to fail it,8
to me and,8
people in america,8
america go hungry,8
the you know,8
you want to,8
and of course,8
people as a,8

seven dollars and,6
and tired of,6
me that we,6
to work rebuilding,6
not get our,6
his pocket and,6
and so i,6
many more are,6
in so many,6
countries throughout the,6
work in the,6
the four largest,6
to put food,6
here is a,6
the credit cards,6
as a people,6
we have lost,6
understand that it,6
women in the,6
a woman to,6
to media reports,6
not accept a,6
today we live,6
by the united,6
super pac and,6
were told that,6
does not mean,6
the person who,6
are the only,6
not just for,6
members of the,6
all americans and,6
wrong when one,6
america will not,6
very very wealthy,6
do it is,6
to a system,6
registered to vote,6
end of the,6
republican family values,6
but there is,6
the bottom forty,6
talk about education,6
not bernie sanders,6
other incredibly wealthy,6
of people to,6
in fact the,6
sexual orientation realizes,6
on the sidelines,6
island unto itself,6
of the ocean,6
making sure that,6
people who were,6
there has been,6
social security and,6
so we can,6
why we are,6
seven beautiful grandchildren,6
countries in the,6
are millions of,6
been involved in,6
income is almost,6
been disappearing despite,6
and they are,6
to work a,6
is almost five,6
to say about,6
is all of,6
doing phenomenally well,6
well in school,6
you do your,6
the recklessness and,6
to describe wall,6
demand that the,6
unemployment is close,6
the world what,6
in two thousand,6
fork in the,6
no one can,6
country in my,6
health care that,6
few of the,6
a record breaking,6
do right now,6
they lost their,6
when it comes,6
and fight back,6
ago we began,6
tell you all,6
the promise of,6
two and a,6
do well in,6
south carolina and,6
in america have,6
in jail and,6
you know who,6
you know we're,6
young people didn't,6
my view we,6
working class kid,6
we need some,6
to expand social,6
country and in,6
when we were,6
to do right,6
more than the,6
in which every,6
the job of,6
in prison during,6
i believe i,6
most vulnerable people,6
of america it,6
is to bring,6
you that we,6
but they are,6
we have come,6
cannot continue to,6
able to live,6
this country once,6
america today is,6
disproportionately african american,6
greed is destroying,6
for every worker,6
no longer continue,6
more sense for,6
who are living,6
is when you,6
were taking on,6
and fifty six,6
is habitable for,6
believe in family,6
came out of,6
one percent and,6
when they need,6
will not only,6
the health care,6
retire with dignity,6
the government out,6
know what they,6
leader of the,6
have seen in,6
the top of,6
legislation that would,6
creating a political,6
not want to,6
politics in america,6
are struggling to,6
supreme court said,6
going to build,6
not a radical,6
economy when we,6
a very long,6
citizens united the,6
bottom forty percent,6
debt we are,6
people understand is,6
people that they,6
can and must,6
the government and,6
she died young,6
is the time,6
feed their families,6
family in this,6
this if you,6
times the rate,6
sense for us,6
those who have,6
night and day,6
made significant progress,6
study hard if,6
million americans have,6
years ago i,6
system has been,6
much economic and,6
controlled apartment in,6
we cannot and,6
the walton family,6
we all going,6
about one person,6
is talking about,6
men have lost,6
to me to,6
is precisely what,6
and when they,6
rent controlled apartment,6
thirteen thousand dollars,6
to be thinking,6
do not do,6
it for a,6
loans to small,6
tuition free and,6
introduced legislation which,6
graduates not dropouts,6
from more than,6
wealth inequality is,6
the same work,6
about fair wages,6
do it alone,6
gonna be a,6
control their own,6
today we are,6
few of their,6
they are very,6
in the mindset,6
that you are,6
i hope all,6
the communities they,6
former foster care,6
they're worried about,6
a family and,6
is no longer,6
together we can,6
ceos of large,6
you look at,6
what i wanted,6
two tenths of,6
the means to,6
in our own,6
american people it,6
people who immigrated,6
against permanent normal,6
the vote to,6
working so hard,6
over the economic,6
more individual contributions,6
and many of,6
what i do,6
to control her,6
and should not,6
seen in recent,6
the and you,6
a campaign which,6
together if we,6
more acidification of,6
the gulf region,6
for possessing marijuana,6
break to the,6
on in this,6
the percentage of,6
of the wealth,6
that is just,6
what they wanted,6
country and all,6
dream was to,6
there is not,6
and campaign contributions,6
i appreciate that,6
for a political,6
this campaign and,6
woman and child,6
on the verge,6
will save the,6
united states congress,6
which is why,6
of the four,6
this country what,6
many african americans,6
to move to,6
fossil fuel and,6
in our political,6
because almost all,6
working two jobs,6
together we have,6
the way i,6
when we bailed,6
that i believe,6
we must do,6
i think that,6
the federal minimum,6
of our economy,6
at all but,6
bottom 130 million,6
millions of dollars,6
are seeing is,6
you and i,6
means to me,6
family does not,6
we are a,6
candidates who will,6
longer continue to,6
on their own,6
this election when,6
must end the,6
of the credit,6
a soap opera,6
three o'clock in,6
organization we had,6
a campaign finance,6
people of the,6
recklessness and the,6
today is going,6
acidification of the,6
and we look,6
of the billionaire,6
what we're doing,6
to change and,6
our rail system,6
drug companies and,6
this country do,6
and universities should,6
nation we have,6
of the house,6
at three o'clock,6
to get to,6
you know and,6
a trillion dollar,6
reason why women,6
which is pretty,6
saying that we,6
not do that,6
burlington vermont that,6
jails and it,6
the powers that,6
human beings and,6
very much the,6
the last election,6
because they will,6
the great political,6
major industrialized country,6
president not bernie,6
a right to,6
and many many,6
everything to do,6
have made significant,6
two major political,6
working three jobs,6
now is not,6
in america the,6
serious issues facing,6
african americans and,6
will do it,6
and that was,6
by fall the,6
not just one,6
large deductibles and,6
has to go,6
do that but,6
out on the,6
going to work,6
get a good,6
more important than,6
senator bernie sanders,6
the voting rights,6
with millions of,6
the loss of,6
our young men,6
has a police,6
people but it,6
when voter turnout,6
i agree with,6
we talked about,6
thank the many,6
there needs to,6
or she is,6
whose parents are,6
of an international,6
tax break to,6
rebuild our infrastructure,6
much of a,6
the verge of,6
we're talking about,6
me that the,6
government belongs to,6
about what's going,6
get all of,6
standing up and,6
when wall street,6
in wealth inequality,6
me say this,6
that no matter,6
does talk about,6
we do we,6
an example of,6
but we are,6
climate change and,6
this country while,6
off the american,6
court decision in,6
are working in,6
you what i,6
president there will,6
that wall street,6
going to fight,6
country and let,6
do the people,6
directly to the,6
it is clear,6
to be released,6
our children and,6
and what this,6
to take the,6
that is to,6
they worry about,6
we have received,6
second wealthiest families,6
american and latino,6
they cannot have,6
funding of elections,6
bit different than,6
is just a,6
and protect our,6
million americans still,6
a job that,6
and make it,6
my republican friends,6
entire world has,6
my view when,6
this type of,6
young people the,6
those are the,6
jobs and the,6
a very important,6
my father came,6
in the workplace,6
color of his,6
vote for people,6
coming out of,6
than he did,6
we end up,6
to get into,6
that our gay,6
thirds of the,6
the age of,6
is too late,6
you are aware,6
street corporate america,6
of large corporations,6
people who get,6
guys you already,6
invest in education,6
united the american,6
that the only,6
seriously they will,6
guaranteeing health care,6
in the industrialized,6
the last midterm,6
american people didn't,6
a great economic,6
that the reason,6
the greed of,6
not the first,6
the thank you,6
out that the,6
so many years,6
organization in the,6
about and i,6
that given the,6
best in the,6
of age or,6
political organization in,6
no matter how,6
the modest gains,6
all understand that,6
race to the,6
very much you,6
what you already,6
be a nation,6
to do the,6
who have been,6
education for our,6
this planet will,6
to bring about,6
own two feet,6
them to be,6
believe i believe,6
from the middle,6
and habitable for,6
a right that,6
and educational opportunities,6
young people in,6
or corporate america,6
a second bill,6
as you know,6
the average middle,6
the effort to,6
that person should,6
years great middle,6
people we can,6
55 years of,6
a year ago,6
and you can,6
i have the,6
see this country,6
for being here,6
is a lot,6
i will continue,6
every other major,6
as the right,6
need to end,6
17 and 20,6
going to win,6
that many of,6
will fight to,6
is owned by,6
activity climate change,6
worried about the,6
very very difficult,6
blunt as i,6
profound message to,6
when people are,6
all the time,6
what happens when,6

that was it,6
dollars to elect,6
this grotesque level,6
continue to get,6
class family thousands,6
ready for a,6
alone and that,6
the media establishment,6
needs of the,6
that is precisely,6
young people that,6
only guarantee health,6
as to how,6
to be when,6
they don't know,6
at the federal,6
to college i,6
is about you,6
democratic party or,6
alone in the,6
to medical school,6
why is it,6
it is hard,6
of the nineteen,6

impose a tax,6
cost effective way,6
backs on the,6
it makes sense,6
very clear that,6
of five americans,6
the women and,6
it comes to,6
get another job,6
my critics say,6
what to do,6
of seniors and,6
an hour over,6
can afford to,6
a vigorous campaign,6
citizens united supreme,6
mind it is,6
that they have,6
money we need,6
in police custody,6

of the largest,6
if they take,6

disastrous trade policies,6
middle class continues,6

it was not,6
not allow huge,6
how to do,6

what country we,4
do not allow,4

the reasons that,4
so much political,4
terms of longevity,4

we have we,4
lead us to,4
find themselves subjected,4
while the average,4
people who should,4

in poverty that's,4
to ask congress,4

feeling that kitchen,4
have not committed,4
bernie is talking,4
com and contribute,4
work the longest,4
bernie sanders can't,4
and you tell,4
of all americans,4
vermont all over,4
not allow that,4
what bernie is,4
tell you is,4
home just tell,4
on in the,4
brave men and,4
cannot even acknowledge,4
end prisons for,4
if the study,4
more floods more,4
middle class when,4
change never takes,4
all about people,4
allowed to gain,4
trade agreements which,4
can not get,4
changes that the,4
the treasury department,4
and a broken,4
hope that we,4
that we did,4
not need to,4
have the people,4
that is part,4
to go ahead,4
tenths of one,4
am running for,4
policies drove us,4
we afford as,4
human beings as,4
of americans struggling,4
about my life,4
is about the,4
the wages and,4
from the federal,4
it's grossly on,4
today the top,4
want those kids,4
of money but,4
right now as,4
socialism for the,4
the world reminds,4
thank you new,4
involved in a,4
sisters it is,4
caucus in the,4
how they're going,4
we want our,4
women doing the,4
got to establish,4
voter turnout and,4
time and a,4
what twenty billion,4
the working people,4
and that includes,4
me and when,4
improve the lives,4
as a lot,4
real change takes,4
me the justice,4
fighting terrorism alone,4
thousand factories and,4
time when every,4
recklessness when we,4
to spend far,4
we make this,4
it all at,4
our country has,4
are the challenges,4
about some of,4
and fifty thousand,4
take on the,4
beautiful state we,4
corporations in this,4
serious problems and,4
family income today,4
the opposition i,4
the economic and,4
school because they,4
sustainable energy this,4
200 people not,4
care for low,4
country that they,4
agree with and,4
when i was,4
in vermont throughout,4
progressive movement was,4
can expect to,4
family will spend,4
may be and,4
have been working,4
brothers sheldon adelson,4
never went to,4
in 2000 and,4
about jobs it's,4
an economy in,4
be tuition free,4
with everything that,4
yet despite that,4
a case manager,4
literally impossible to,4
year ago when,4
political process not,4
corporations are doing,4
to be investing,4
that the system,4
sense to invest,4
workers paid medical,4
about is the,4
which is going,4
in the democratic,4
you run as,4
to vote these,4
ground and not,4
think we have,4
45 billion dollars,4
making profits by,4
few days ago,4
stand together on,4
acknowledge the scientific,4
which ordinary americans,4
distressed for decades,4
me except the,4
pharmaceutical industry will,4
will echo from,4
that reality and,4
i think is,4
the bottom hundred,4
the day they,4
tonight and that,4
people to say,4
out this is,4
american to be,4
rigged economy and,4
soon as well,4
rigged economy in,4
the community not,4
about this we,4
that when a,4
in a dangerous,4
remember the last,4
workers are on,4
social security we,4
do as a,4
that pays them,4
provide jobs and,4
do you don't,4
in rebuilding our,4
lock them up,4
in which wall,4
and especially in,4
i tell you,4
the country and,4
the world who,4
their unemployment rate,4
longer hours than,4
he's going to,4
implement as president,4
find a job,4
one issue that,4
21st century and,4
to defend american,4
republican party brothers,4
the food that,4
that is when,4
to be doing,4
so i grew,4
move toward a,4
most people don't,4
having a hotline,4
single day that's,4
statistic which includes,4
people in prison,4
this when the,4
democratic party will,4
orientation realizes the,4
do it because,4
in a government,4
to be incarcerated,4
includes those people,4
now what has,4
do it well,4
for the role,4
i'm talking about,4
the dream act,4
not necessarily with,4
any other industrialized,4
breaking voter turnout,4
buy the medicine,4
portable camera it,4
a hundred billion,4
woman to control,4
of the supreme,4
out in the,4
here today the,4
and progressives win,4
making so many,4
have in this,4

to follow in,4
where we have,4
is not quite,4
period on lobbying,4
small and medium,4
many parts of,4
they give you,4

as much as,4
resources we have,4
washington d c,4

issue that we,4
the serious problems,4
phenomenally well what,4
a financial institution,4
than one million,4
the first place,4

to do use,4
every family in,4
community in their,4
up i want,4
who has been,4
don't think so,4
the american and,4
full promise of,4
six thousand signatures,4
why so many,4
today 30 by,4
is a strong,4
to jail i,4
and they understand,4
to send my,4
is they will,4
no question about,4
america what we,4
you pay attention,4
was something that,4
900 million dollars,4
briefly give you,4
a year locking,4
class they will,4
are telling us,4
you know do,4
caretakers all our,4
other minorities find,4
a profound political,4
some money they,4
by a five,4
with their baby,4
have anything to,4
will happen all,4
about transforming our,4
banks under investigation,4
a look at,4
burning so in,4
jpmorgan chase bank,4
am the former,4
and fifty billion,4
on the front,4
together on they're,4
against the trans,4
cuts to social,4
they are sworn,4
you how it,4
to add insult,4
they are earning,4
it is expensive,4
police departments we,4
part 3 did,4
street and the,4
after two years,4
year of high,4
hour job is,4
i've landed them,4
heart i would,4
today one of,4
the recipient of,4
make any sense,4
so what this,4
the time is,4
united states one,4
continue to be,4
the killing of,4
in a medicare,4
just from progressives,4
low income families,4
schools really bernie,4
president the united,4
the way we,4
they say what,4
money for the,4
united states was,4
school degree was,4
has not yet,4
you know him,4
in half the,4
i hope every,4
on eleven twelve,4
their academics seriously,4
with the 1,4
planet we are,4
of the political,4
much too long,4
these are my,4
revolution which takes,4
percentage of former,4
saying no one,4
period of time,4
of the characters,4
should cut social,4
create a new,4
jobs in this,4
we win this,4
know the city,4
are all over,4
want to take,4
system that is,4
all going to,4
increase in technology,4
federal level we,4
having to big,4
should be tuition,4
scientific community has,4
industry that they,4
that they could,4
it makes the,4
lack the funds,4
how long we,4
very demoralized in,4
only way that,4
to jail that,4
women and fight,4
is what will,4
we create millions,4
make a whole,4
will do everything,4
again and now,4
so your point,4
right that is,4
and health care,4
a strong issue,4
veterans and i,4
believe that this,4
them to tell,4
hillary clinton it,4
get into trouble,4
they can win,4
want kids and,4

our nation in,4
today today we,4
take the fight,4

less than he,4
american and asian,4
this country don't,4
americans this world,4
country and what,4
job in america,4
turnout in the,4
the large campaign,4
our government belong,4
what appears to,4
income today is,4
my view it,4
those millions of,4
when pollsters go,4
as if it,4
12 weeks of,4
i thought i,4
if they have,4
working families to,4
this country create,4
29 million americans,4
sea levels and,4
i think about,4
be arrested and,4
female and people,4
the day that,4
where people are,4
mother graduated high,4
for the very,4
can be in,4
african american community,4
vote we are,4
be doing the,4
i'll let me,4
when we are,4
the point that,4
and the discussion,4
be now we're,4
they said is,4
tell me the,4
can bring about,4
well rather than,4
time republicans occupied,4
from maine to,4
mean from the,4
about you and,4
searched during a,4
first year of,4
up the united,4
a way to,4
let's go to,4
is people coming,4
an entire generation,4
do the things,4
with the department,4
profoundly wrong went,4
from the koch,4
we lead the,4
that would create,4
break them up,4
richer and everyone,4
you invest in,4
show the american,4
specifically you know,4
high school and,4
nation on earth,4
care in the,4
us and the,4
to racist attacks,4
earth you would,4
issues facing the,4
that's what happens,4
despite the modest,4
without saying no,4
great kids and,4
the longest hours,4
medical and family,4
better off today,4
invest in drug,4
and so you,4
and voter turnout,4
we started this,4
in nutrition programs,4
all our environment,4
the fed provided,4
you are into,4
you don't need,4
this country including,4
is where we,4
and child as,4
and that millions,4
the way this,4
energy system and,4
time of massive,4
the families of,4
and elections it,4
are working hard,4
and fair election,4
have fought and,4
of that apartment,4
out it is,4
add insult to,4
do what we,4
these very same,4
essential part of,4
know what we,4
making certain that,4
000 people of,4
or three percent,4
interest in the,4
to me rice,4
people throughout this,4
free and fair,4
place and that,4
lost their jobs,4
arithmetic as well,4
rate was thirty,4
year locking up,4
government represents all,4
has more well,4
when families in,4
are still not,4
are very demoralized,4
not want a,4
to invade iraq,4
was a principal,4
the way a,4
we can continue,4
campaign so far,4
an easy job,4
thirty forty or,4
middle class if,4
wall street today,4
a very competitive,4
education let me,4
in the citizens,4
the number of,4
know where else,4
class kid i,4
america is to,4
mass killing and,4
just the young,4
we should do,4
raised the minimum,4
states has to,4
and almost four,4
when you want,4
a very radical,4
you something medial,4
all of which,4
to make that,4
around this country,4
life as a,4
today who are,4
since nineteen the,4
people want us,4
can be a,4
income inequality the,4
go out in,4
of longevity how,4
and when i,4
and learn an,4
did and i,4
to overturn that,4
few have so,4
to do this,4
percent well people,4
quality than any,4
in the right,4
americans and the,4
to young people,4
system very very,4
largest corporations in,4
try to cut,4
us into the,4
never gonna be,4
you doing for,4
almost a billion,4
and the federal,4
know what that,4
in washington the,4
with the people,4
said is that,4
means to a,4
pollsters go out,4
and dishonesty and,4
be a right,4
america it means,4
a government dominated,4
university of california,4
defend us get,4
talk about democracy,4
school deeply in,4
of a collective,4
we have created,4
but at the,4
decision let me,4
i use that,4
the civil rights,4
the fear of,4
opportunity to buy,4
richest people in,4
that means that,4
we can't do,4
but i am,4
will be voting,4
is kinda expensive,4
amounts of money,4
as some of,4
the rights of,4
also have do,4
the new york,4
a simple principle,4
time when an,4
was it was,4
you think about,4
all the scientific,4
medial kinda forgot,4
fraud and dishonesty,4
they should be,4
it exists in,4
can work with,4
not a government,4
wife jane and,4
in which millions,4
looking at politics,4
twelve thirteen thousand,4
jane and i,4
but when we,4
state in america,4
something that we,4
leave for my,4
them what is,4
and a path,4
very very very,4
a few years,4
workers it is,4
i would not,4
about issues facing,4
the normal trade,4
full voting rights,4
bottom 90 one,4
be voting to,4
pre k system,4
to work making,4
for that is,4
but when it,4
to the koch,4
decades ago that,4
as president is,4
to fight to,4
depression and if,4
that in a,4
system is now,4
and i thought,4
who in our,4
our responsibility uses,4
me just very,4
and scientists and,4
of a society,4
for so many,4
power of executive,4
we have over,4
banking system in,4
study came out,4
not made it,4
graduate high school,4
my like and,4
to put millions,4

have a website,4
five term democrat,4
reality and the,4
higher rates than,4
get involved in,4
the top three,4
a message not,4
people didn't bowl,4
my mother graduated,4
that i had,4
up until this,4

this not just,4
student interest rates,4
do american democracy,4

work you can't,4
that our children,4
the keystone pipeline,4
talk to you,4
what we talked,4
really it is,4
nominally well when,4
on the ballot,4
of school she,4
by a handful,4
to the future,4
message is you,4
private corporations making,4
those who seek,4
and it's kinda,4
country we need,4
hope every man,4
is over half,4
is that today,4
people horseshoes between,4
last couple days,4
the fourth grade,4
and improve lives,4
their greed and,4
wealth inequality it,4
the median male,4
you is that,4
one hundred billion,4
to look further,4
important step forward,4
is a moral,4
let me too,4
police departments all,4
you about some,4
you can't have,4
helped destroy the,4
the son of,4
americans and other,4
whole lot my,4
that gay people,4
months ago this,4
the table the,4
the wic program,4
generated today is,4
14 wealthiest people,4
have talked to,4
didn't know working,4
be campaigning on,4
i'm gonna give,4
if it were,4
know that a,4
lived in terms,4
doing here today,4
jobs in america,4
remember and this,4
guys ready for,4
in his inaugural,4
people on trial,4
go out to,4
that but in,4
for all our,4
will see you,4
change because we,4
power to get,4
we don't have,4
have been arrested,4
of one person,4
book for the,4
will make it,4
understand that there,4
very very good,4
know the with,4
child care in,4
support comes from,4
that you could,4
control the republican,4
simply and straightforwardly,4
need to take,4
of our children,4
head start and,4
school we have,4
cuts in medicaid,4
don't know how,4
to collect six,4
it harder for,4
to too many,4
to college because,4
message that will,4
that since 2001,4
that they say,4
people can have,4
what does that,4
the so i,4
the reason that,4
come from a,4
bit about the,4
take a hard,4
dollars to buy,4
country one of,4
it is simply,4
luther king junior,4
is only one,4
seem to be,4
to a family,4
time that we,4
likely to experience,4
wall street speculators,4
want trade agreements,4
have so little,4
being generated today,4
is thinking big,4
to touch on,4
a proliferation up,4
when i think,4
and millions more,4
only way we,4
now that is,4
even acknowledge the,4
they stand for,4
long they worry,4
do that because,4
looking at the,4
stop us from,4
around a progressive,4
to come out,4
rather than addressing,4
generations what began,4
is well we,4
be searched during,4
made a whole,4
friends we must,4
country we had,4
political life of,4
not nominate any,4
with an incall,4
do that when,4
should be the,4
in many parts,4
to the middle,4
full time when,4
income being generated,4
me so i,4
they say the,4
we that we've,4
school graduates not,4
owns more wealth,4
who immigrated here,4
the vote two,4
my view you,4
with the same,4
win an election,4
my nominees to,4
politics in a,4
okay you can't,4
home and we,4
i will see,4
jumped up and,4
the other higher,4
start paying the,4
political if you,4
lead the fight,4
corporations making profits,4
of the intellectual,4
that was in,4
to know what,4
to the ceos,4
comes from the,4
is a message,4
we need more,4
is that gay,4
oil companies in,4
end up back,4
right now across,4
america we will,4
four times our,4
work with china,4
is not and,4
a year and,4
up the american,4
national health care,4
senate and the,4
to be there,4
less discriminatory society,4
i thank her,4
to think for,4
that once again,4
campaign i hope,4
today the united,4
justice system and,4
united states being,4
kinds the ground,4
income generated in,4
know what are,4
have a look,4
had no campaign,4
establishment to the,4
campaign and the,4
let me know,4
such long hours,4
were when we,4
time african americans,4
not trust the,4
immigration system that,4
case the american,4
the right thing,4
problem that we,4
all people in,4

america or in,2
of wisconsin because,2

my view what,2
saying this if,2

caseworker but they,2
to give all,2
just the need,2
takes on and,2
have made more,2
campaign contributions when,2
poverty center dot,2

rigged economy that,2
one student was,2
do not become,2
congressional history i,2
the truth will,2
their support many,2
country that real,2
best say a,2
sea levels mauled,2
lots of homes,2
maybe more important,2
not non we,2
for putting on,2
refuse to cooperate,2
baby has to,2
lives destroyed we,2
mental health is,2

country was sensible,2
only candidate for,2
tell young lady,2
their share of,2
americans hatred of,2

better but we,2
i've been reading,2
system where you,2
in education for,2

care fees on,2
clipboard morally a,2
preschoolers account 48,2
in syria the,2

respect of the,2
the trade my,2
establishment economics and,2

have a rigged,2
who get sick,2
see every week,2
the justice department,2
so called defense,2
only functional but,2
what ten you're,2

topiary to accept,2

but to drop,2

for them so,2
coming together saying,2
is not think,2
served immigration roflol,2
up in it,2
cut in the,2
money for jails,2
we have will,2
we must follow,2
authoritarianism communist country,2

very decently but,2
it went to,2
without education without,2
to spend you're,2
people all health,2
should have our,2
won't stand up,2
like your paper,2
13 13 anyone,2
upward and i'm,2

you what we,2
this couple hours,2
year tonight here,2
times they end,2
politics and culture,2
half the debate,2
in our history,2
rumored into this,2
truth is and,2
exciting i'm wondering,2
of billion revolution,2
maybe our family,2
have done also,2
its purpose was,2
of california the,2
wonders today prime,2
businesses so they,2
and why i,2
us and we,2
largest corporations start,2
we should practice,2
elections when we,2
of this has,2
will be not,2
many people stood,2
i just bought,2
it really breaks,2
families not to,2
drove this economy,2
and my suggestion,2
americans are clearly,2
getting a lot,2
well together but,2
is more well,2
personal in politics,2
have made of,2
about was see,2
that these kids,2
new rules on,2

lebanon in their,2
party whether people,2
it one it's,2
the prison complex,2
was the kids,2
virtual to finance,2
country has lost,2
found but i'm,2
described as socialist,2
incredible leadership in,2
later on 35,2
all branches of,2
wages the car,2
for that gentleman,2
along to a,2
very negative rates,2
we can now,2
that this program,2
understand is this,2
what a living,2
done also want,2
cultural issue we,2
inequality but a,2
out with a,2
infrastructure and millions,2
families now in,2
searched desperately for,2
is about yet,2
of too many,2
good people often,2
this treated wanted,2
is not cold,2

governors trails all,2
how crazy it,2
woman was virtually,2
universities 23 of,2

climate change there,2

only pulled on,2
reality of where,2
out is that,2
they're so dismayed,2
work in any,2
is not i'll,2
outline arbitrage and,2
closed secretary clinton,2
