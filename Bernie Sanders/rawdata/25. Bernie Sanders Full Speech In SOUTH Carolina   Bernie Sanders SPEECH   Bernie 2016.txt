beautiful introductions and thank you
Charleston for their stern
and let me tell you you are a proud
taken a huge relief
to the boys and what the point is is
this campaign is about bringing people
together
because when we bring the middle-class
and working-class together when we bring
white and black and Hispanic Native
American men and women trading ok now
you look for
where we can't stop us from transforming
the country
the american people are beginning to
catch on to what's going on in this
country
sick and tired of establishment politics
tired of establishment economics and
with the establishment media
the people of this country on the stand
one fundamental point and that his
corporate greed in america
that it is immoral that is unsustainable
good almost all of the new wealth
generated in this country is going to
the top one percent and you were taught
together I gotta change that
understand that we have a corrupt
political system went billion are able
to buy politicians will joke
and what we know what the candidate will
say and that is we cannot bring about
the kind of changes that we need in this
country there is a political revolution
and what clearly is that this great
country of ours belongs to all of us not
just a handful of billionaires
but Americans and the reason they don't
understand the reason they don't feel it
is that almost all well and all of that
income is going to be a few together is
to create an economy that works for
working families not just the people on
trial
very very rich and everyone else that in
any time since the nineteen twenties the
issue of wealth and income inequality is
the great moral issue of our time the
great economic you're sure the great
political
together we are going
when the top one tenth of one percent 1
of 1 percent almost as much well as the
bottom 90%
there is something profoundly wrong when
we have seen in recent years the
proliferation of millionaires and
billionaires while the average American
Fork slog around was for low wages and
we have the highest rate of childhood
poverty of any major country
there is something profoundly wrong when
one of the Walton family owns well forty
percent of the American people
enough
and it's contrary this campaign and the
people of america are sending a message
and that message is simple you cannot
continue
you are not going to continue to get
huge tax regs when children in america
go hungry
corporate America and the billion not
gonna continue to send out jobs to China
and other countries when millions here
that's really good paying jobs are not
going to put their billions in profit in
the Cayman Islands to avoid paying their
fair share of taxes
we are saying loudly and clearly is
corporate greed and we are going to end
it
income and wealth inequality not only
impact every state in america my state
of Vermont let me tell you how it
impacts in South Carolina and the last
two years if you can believe it ought
wealthiest people in this country
whattt not a lot of people there well
increase by a hundred and fifty six
billion dollars
while the billion become much much
richer 27 percent of the children here
in South Carolina are living in poverty
what's million children in America and
its South Carolina
those children 11 and poverty $138,000
black 95,000 all-white 30,000 this
across the board and impacts every race
and together we are ashamed of having
the highest child poverty rate
no country which is great
turns its back on children no country
proud country leaves kids childcare
without these housing and when we talk
about basic rights about the needs of
everyone is human beings let us talk
about health care
that the United States is the only
country to all people
why I believe medicare program
insurance companies and the drug
companies and the big money interests
like what their day is going to come
uninsured population almost in half the
number of from 20 percent to 12 percent
a small box and South Carolina
health insurance and legislature of this
as provided for in the Affordable Care
Act
health care in this country
last month I asked I asked them and kids
who are high school graduates between
the ages of 17 and 20 and what their
unemployment and underemployment rates
were
this is what they found if the kids were
white high school graduates 70 20 33
percent of them were unemployed if they
were 36% 51%
more than any other country on her
china is a country much much larger than
china is a communist authoritarian
country pretty tough stuff we have more
people in jail and let me tell you if
anybody believe that there is a direct
connection between five and a half
million people in this country who have
no jobs and school if you think there is
not a connection between that reality
and the fact that so many people are in
jail you would be sorely mistaken
as president building more jails instead
of locking more people
$7
and when we talk let me ask all of the
men who are here tonight just stand with
women and fight
have been married for 27
my Republican colleagues
of America
unforgettable when your baby comes in
the world and is a pretty big day for
the baby as well and democracy in South
Carolina if that woman that family have
decent incomes mom can stay home
weeks and months and long and nourish
the most important time
box if mom's family does not have
sufficient you know what happens that
baby is separated from because her mom
has to go back to work in five days or
ten days
and that is why I will fight to make
sure that every family in America gets
three months of pay
and we are also gonna of America being
the only major country on earth does not
provide pay guarantees will pay
unemployment in america is all but 10
percent of youth unemployment is thirty
forty fifty percent it is clear to me
that the United States government wants
to be a major jobs program to put our
people back to work
South Carolina State of Vermont all over
america our infrastructure our roads our
bridges our rail system water plants
wastewater infrastructure is crumbling I
have proposed a trillion dollar
investment let us rebuild our
infrastructure put
when we talk about jobs create millions
of jobs we must the loss of millions of
jobs to trade policies trade policies so
how has all of america you are looking
at the United States congressman who
voted against not permanent normal trade
position
corporate america wants to buy their
products wants us to purchase products
airtight I'm not a child
what is the most important is impossible
to one issue that impacts every five
years ago as most of you know by a
five-to-four decision the Supreme Court
of the United States
poorly with the Citizens United case
and what they said people in America you
already own much of america
the economy opportunity to purchase the
United States and that here's what they
are trying to do right now
American political system today as a
result of Citizens United has been
totally corrupted and the foundations of
American democracy are being american
democracy is not supposed to be about
buying elections and buying american
democracy is supposed to be one person
one vote
many campaign promises to you right now
and that is any of mine to the United
States Supreme Court will make it loud
and clear that he or she will vote to
overturn
in the world
democracy and when we talk about one
person
fifty years ago congress passed the
president johnson's full voting rights
act and what the Voting Rights Act
finally here's that every american has
the right to vote regardless of the
color of his or her skin
got one of the most important provisions
of the Voting Rights out and literally
supreme court based its decision
republican governors and attorney
generals and legislators began to go to
work to figure out how they could deny
poor people and people of color and old
people the right to vote
you know I have been involved in many
campaigns in my state of Vermont Ave Los
51 many are curved Jimmy never once
tried to figure out a way to deny my
opponents I believe
win elections based on the strength of
your ideas not by keeping
I have been introduced which will go a
long way to make one very simple point
and america if you are a team you
registered to vote
people who have do not have the guts to
campaign on their ideas people who think
the only way they can win not to vote
these people political cowards they
should get another job
that in america today we are living in a
very highly competitive global economy
and of our economy is the succeed in the
future we need the best in the world are
you human tragedy that today hundreds of
thousands of bright young people kids
well done well in school kids who are
qualified to get a higher education on
not able to go to college for one reason
and one reason alone and that is their
families lack the money
that is not what america it is unfair to
those young people who want to become
doctors they want a rise out of poverty
to make it into the middle class and
we're pullin
but it is even if we talk about the
future of America well we need all of
the bright people we can make our
economy strong growth
I have introduced legislation and we'll
make it happen if elected president to
make every college and university in
America through which three
financial today
like my family
their parents never went to college they
don't know anybody who went to college
the idea of going to college is beyond
their wildest I want those kids to know
that if they do their homework if they
take school seriously they will be able
to go to college
regardless
levels of school
and here's the crazy there are people
with food and debt paying interest rates
of 68 10 percent when you can refinance
your home
three or four percent
people to refinance at lower interest
rates
of profiteering
profit from working-class families who
simply wanted to send the college
when we talk about our responsibilities
as human beings as parents as adults
there is nothing more than I can then
making certain that we leave this planet
to our children and grandchildren in a
way that is habitable
scientific community is virtually
unanimous climate change is real climate
change is caused by human activity and
climate change is already causing
problems in our country and around the
world
years we have a small window of
opportunity basically a few use to get
our act together to transform our energy
system or else by the end of this
century the planet earth will be five to
10 degrees warmer more trials drought
flood were extreme weather disturbances
more acidification of the ocean more
rising sea levels and the CIA tells us
more conflict around the world as people
fight over a limited natural resources
we have a moral responsibility to work
with China and Russia and India to lead
the world and moving away from fossil
fuel energy efficiency and sustainable
ranking member Leader of the Opposition
on the democratic side on the budget
committee about national priorities and
about values I want you to know that a
number of months ago the republicans
passed a budget in the congress they
control the house and the Senate and
this is what their budget and I want
everybody including working class people
who vote Republican to know what was
what was in that budget is repeal of the
Affordable Care Act massive cuts in
medicaid the result 27 million more
Americans lose health insurance
republicans what happens when 27 how
many of them how many of them
trying to put food on the table
they found but I'm 250 billion dollars
in tax breaks to one person
was a greedy multi-million working-class
and middle-class Republican support
our job this campaign may be the most
important thing we can do is to get
people in america working people middle
class people low-income people voting
wanna make cuts veterans programs
are we not gonna
also that when men and women country we
are not gonna cut veterans' benefits
and when we talk about our country what
kind of country we know that it can be
we must be very clear that we are going
to end
institutional racism and we are going to
transform
and we all going to trans and make
radical changes in a criminal justice
system that is broken
the good news in terms of combating
racism over the last many many decades
not far enough but if we were sitting
here thirty years ago and somebody said
well you know I think in 2008 people of
the United States overcame hundreds of
years of racism and we will be
collecting an african-american is
president of the united states nobody
would have believed that but in fact
2008 the American people look beyond the
color of a candidate's can look at his
ideas and voted for Obama
of american society no one can deny I am
not just talking about the sixth of a
man walking to class 4a where people
take out a gun and kill nine people that
is literally impossible to comprehend
and I'm not just talking about the
hundreds of hate groups that exists only
function they are only function of
african-americans immigrants or gays or
juice can you imagine a group whose only
functional but in addition to clear them
talking about racism we are talking
about sound for bland Michael Brown
about Eric gone are we talking about
Walter Scott pretty grey and many are we
do not know died unnecessarily and
wrongly at the hands of police offices
or in police custody must change
nobody will raise our broken
things to be done in order to the
community
people trust
a whole lot of police officers in my
community and if anybody hear things
today is an easy job you're wrong and
the vast majority of police offices
tried to do the best they can honestly
and protecting the people but
by the way many of these police officers
are underpaid they have crazy schedules
and live under enormous stress what
police official breaks that police
officer must be held accountable
new rules regarding the use of force to
break up crowds to prevent violence and
what good police officers do that with
us and lethal force should be the last
thing
americans are in jail for non violent
crimes we need to rethink the war on
drugs
I really remarkable young person's
criminal record but the crux on wall
street who destroyed our economy
lot of people around the country have
been talking about and I agree with and
when congress reconvenes in September
introduced legislation and that is to
end the absurdity of private
corporations making profits by running
jails and building
people further addiction drug addiction
are illnesses that need to be treated
drug courts and medical and mental
health intervention
are providing and they serve time and
they got out of jail and they have no
education they have no jobs no money no
housing
associate with exactly the same people
that got him in jail and all end up back
in jail
point of view and it makes no sense from
a financial point of view it costs more
money to put people in jail to the
University of South Carolina
all of you are aware that we live in a
nation in which a handful of very very
wealthy people have extraordinary power
over our economy and our political life
and that's the reality they are very
very powerful and many of them are
extremely greedy I will never understand
how families like the Koch brothers work
a deal worth 85 billion dollars
apparently think they need more and more
and they're willing to the children the
elderly the sick and the poor in order
to become even richer I will never
understand that kind of green
yes yes but there is something that they
don't have we have the people and when
we stand together
in the wealthiest country in the history
of the world do not
create
country mom and dad go to work they know
that their child care in the world in
which all of our people get a college
education
weekend the most vulnerable people
including our seniors seniors choose
between medicine and food
and what's and women who put their lives
on the line to defend us get the health
care and all of the benefits that they
deserve
we can live in which everyone no matter
their race religion no matter their
disability no matter their sexual
orientation
realizes full potential of what America
is about equality for all
the day after the election
sexual orientation
