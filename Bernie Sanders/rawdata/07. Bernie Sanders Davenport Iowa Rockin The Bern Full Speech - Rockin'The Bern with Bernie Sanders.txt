apathy enemy is sinister we have the
solution for that please allow me to
introduce to you the next president of
the United States of America so that are
running
how'd you like the pics of history
going
not been done that is put together a
grassroots movement which takes on and
defeat the political and economic
establishment of his country
all over this country not just that
maybe just maybe we have a government
that represents the middle class and
working families rather than building a
corporate America
win just so you know what goes on
politically in this country the rich get
richer everybody else gets coral and
then people get dissolution and they say
you know I can't afford to send my kids
to college or working what are these
guys going on a boat facts are wrong
right answer is we and we change their
own woman born in this country
draw is together to fight for gender the
works for all people
a handful I don't know I don't know what
are trying a little bit strange that is
the wealthiest country in the history of
the world really high rate of childhood
poverty right a little weird well
quality than any other major country on
earth where the top 10 almost as much
well as the bottom 90%
right we've got people were true with
three drawers 50 60 hours a week
get 58 percent of all new income
1 percent right this country we have
more people in jail
proportionately african-american and
Hispanic more people to tell that any
other country order
prior to be maybe it makes more sense
for us to win
education
education rather than jails and it cost
a little bit strange to me that in the
wealthiest nation in the history of the
world which is what we are today we are
the only major country that doesn't
guarantee healthcare go over well as a
right of the trade my Republican
colleagues about family values what
they're really talking about you're
saying that we should not be able to
control their own bodies talking about
talk about their brothers and sisters
should not be able to get buried my wife
and I place
got quarter to seven grandchildren we
have a different set of how about a
United States joins the rest of the
world in case you don't have to live on
a level of $12,000 Social Security maybe
we raised and expand social security
benefits maybe we tell the truck
companies to stop ripping off the
american people
I wanna see this country the most
vibrant democracy in the world I don't
want to see your voter turnouts as we
did a year ago when 63 percent of
Americans vote eighty percent of young
people know that's not what american
democracy should be about voter
suppression we are going to make it
easier for people to not harder and the
other thing that we're gonna do as we
restore real democracy to this country
we're going to overturn this disastrous
citizens united Supreme Court
tell you that we are very few major
presidential campaigns that does not
have a super PAC I don't have a billion
or corporate America and I am immensely
proud to tell you what we have received
more individual campaign contributions
at this point in the campaign that any
campaign in american history
we are running
we are running
president election
works in other words one of the things
that we are talking about I want to the
pictures
high school degree you can take care of
your family today so what seems sensible
is that when we think of public
education we have to expand beyond great
which is why I am fighting
public colleges and universities to we
should three
and why we are also going to
substantially lower interest rates on
student but here's how we're going to
raise money and why I need your help to
make this happen
a speculation acts on Wall Street
happy about this one then when as a
result of the reckless and illegal
behavior you now here I put them to help
the middle class of this country
or look out the window
read your emails listen that's what the
american people want is creating a
political revolution your friends
president if you're interested in
transforming the United States of
America if you're interested in
participating in a political revolution
we need your help thank you
