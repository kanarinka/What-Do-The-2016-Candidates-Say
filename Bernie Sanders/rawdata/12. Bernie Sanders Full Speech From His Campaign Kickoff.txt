please welcome back Cohen and Jerry

%uh
the
the
the one
and honor Ford van and me to be here
supporting Bernie Sanders a man who for
all over
thirty years has been fighting for
fairness
and against injustice and I feel so
lucky
and millions of Americans
across the country are lucky that we can
now
join bernie in this fight the
you know
front-runner business as usual politics
from either party is just more of the
same
more money for the ultra-wealthy and
nice for everybody else
more profits for oil companies and less
clean air debris
more money for jails and defense
contractors
and pharmaceutical companies and less
money for schools
lifting people out of poverty and
creating a healthier society
both physically and spiritually
this system isn't broken it fixed
it's great it's no accident
that corporate profits through through
the room while wages are stagnant
it's no accident that ninety percent of
the wealth created in the last five
years
has gone to the top one percent the laws
are written by politicians
to please the corporations and the
ultra-wealthy
who bought those politicians with
millions of dollars
up so-called political campaign
contributions
otherwise known as legalized bribery
the and Bernie s led the fight to put an
end to it
unlike some johnny-come-lately stew the
issues
bernie is the real thing %uh
he's not about reading the polls and
figuring out what he needs to say in
order to get elected
he said now and unwavering commitment
to basic Justice a quality and sound
financial sets
the
I mean the guys been saying and doing
the same stuff for the last thirty years
in
if he weren't so inspiring he'd be
pouring he's about leading with his
heart and his soul
and using his brain to do what's best
for the little guy
the guy who is ignored by the political
elite
until it's time to ask for their book
you know some say that voting for Bernie
is throwing your vote away %uh
I they say that voting for anyone else
is flushing our country down the drain
%uh
the the
and you know sometimes the underdog
links
in the early days depending Jerry
when we were barely available outside
firm are
the pillsbury corporation owners have
Haagen Dazs
were illegally trying to put us out of
business
we couldn't afford to fight them in
court
but we took our case to the people
an appeal to their sense of fairness and
one
%uh and the country found out what the
Doughboy I was afraid
this is a guy with the
vision and that got sent the smarts to
return America to what made our country
great
in the first place for those who have
been sitting on the sidelines
finally a candidate worth voting for
the
and you know what if we all get all of
our butts
and work for any bernie will def by
the experts once again and he'll wear
the
the
you know in the end there's a spiritual
dimension to all this
as Tracy Chapman saying hunger for a
tasty justice
hunger only for a world that truth
costs all that you have is your sole
so let this be the start
up the Bernie rebellion the
a rebellion against big money in
politics that has corrupted our
government a rebellion against
inequality and shoving marginalize

of our country and here is my promise

of millions of Americans what prayer
prepared to stand up

we are going to take this campaign
directly to the people in town meetings
daughter door conversations on street
corners
and its social media the
this week we're gonna be in new
hampshire
we're gonna be an Iowa and we're gonna
be in Minnesota
and that is just a thought August archer
okay
%uh out
let me be clear this campaign
is not about Bernie Sanders it's not
about hillary Clinton it is not about
jeb bush or anyone else this campaign
is about but needs of the american
people
%uh
and the ideas and proposals
that up effectively addressed does the
as someone who has never run
a naked up political ad in my life
%uh
my campaign will not be driven
white political gossip or reckless
personal attacks out
this is wat the American people
wat and deserved these are serious times
weenie serious debates %uh
politics
in a democratic society should not be
treated
as if it were a baseball game
eight-game gameshow or a salt
opera and I hope to me dr
understand side as well %uh
let me take a minute
to touch on some of the issues then I
will be focusing on in the coming month
and then give you a brief outline
arbitrage and up for
America up and agenda which in fact
will deal with the serious problems and
lead us
to a better future today
today we live in a nation which is the
wealthiest nation in the history of the
world
what got reality means very little
for most robust because almost all of
that wealth
is owned and controlled by a tiny
handful of individuals in america
we now have wat income and wealth
inequality
than any other major country on earth
and the gap between
not very rich should everyone else if
growing
wider NY the airshow
while and income inequality is for great
moral issue of our time it is for
greater economic issue
of our time it is for great political
issue
all about I'm and we well address it
%uh
and
like me
be very clear and let the clock
1 percent understand this there is
something profoundly wrong
when the top 110 up 1 percent
owns own both of us much well ever
bottom ninety percent
and when ninety-nine percent all
no income go through the top what
percent
there is something profoundly wrong
where in recent years we have seen a
proliferation of millionaires
and billionaires at the same time X
millions of Americans
are working longer hours polo wagers
and we have shamefully the highest rate
our childhood poverty of any major
country
there is something profoundly wrong
went 1 family one family
all swallow wealth in this country than
the bottom
130 million Americans
this grotesque level
update equality is the moral it is bad
economics
it is unsustainable this type of
wreck the economy if not what america
is supposed to be about this has got to
change
and as your president took cab up we are
going to change it
one it's not just
income and wealth inequality it is a
tragic reality
that for the last forty years great
middle-class
about country 13 NV up the entire world
has been disappearing despite
exploding technology and increased
worker productivity
median family income is almost five
thousand dollars less today
that it was in 1999 in our great state
and all over this country people are
working not one drop
but to drop three jobs trying to cobble
together
any car and some healthcare back is not
acceptable we can inbox do better
the truth there's the real unemployment
is not
5.4 percent what you read in the papers
it is close to 11 percent youth
unemployment seventy percent
african-american youth unemployment
of but rocks today
shamefully we are 45 million people
living in poverty
many of whom are working and low-wage
job in america today despite the gains
of the Affordable Care Act 35 million
Americans
still lack any help injured my friends
diana is the reality
upper-middle-class in america today
and not is a reality not just for our
what for our kids and our grandchildren
that we
are going to change
my fellow americans love me as
want be as blunt as I can and tell you
what you already know
as a result other disastrous Supreme
Court decision
I'm citizens united the American
political system
has been totally corrupted and the
foundations of American democracy
on now being undermine what the supreme
court said
sexually was that it was not good enough
with the billionaires own March up the
economy
they could now all the United States
government
as well and that is precisely what
they are trying to do
now when I learned in school and I they
quickly many women who put their lives
on the line to defend our country
have long know that american democracy
is not about billionaires
being able to buy candidates and by
election
it is thought about the Koch brothers
Sheldon Adelson
and other incredibly wealthy individuals
spending billions of dollars
to elect candidates who will make the
rich richer
and everyone else poor according to
media reports that you can't believe it
the Koch brothers in this election cycle
are prepared to spend more money but I
believe the Democratic
or Republican Party's that is not
democracy
that is oligarchy
in vermont throughout town meetings we
know what democracy is about that as one
person
one-vote and not for karnal political
system
we are going to fight law and are going
to achieve
now when we talk about
our responsibilities as human beings
that as per
there's nothing more important leaving
this country and the entire planet
in a way that is habitable for our kids
and our grandchildren
but the bay is over scientific community
has spoken
in a virtually unanimous boys climate
change is real
it is caused by human activity and is
already causing
devastating problems in our country and
around the world and let's be clear
if we do not get our act together
and happy United slates leave the world
in combat in climate change there will
be a boy drowned more
famine more rising sea level wat wud
warm ocean acidification more
extreme weather disturbances airs
human being will work out all well
this environment who appreciate
the beauty that we have on this planet
we are not going to allow
a fossil fuel industry the Detroit
their line
out
brothers and sisters it is no secret
that there is massive discontent with
politics in america today
in the last picture malek should some 63
percent of Americans
did not bowl including eighty percent
young people
poll after poll tells of that all
citizens no longer have confidence
in our political institutions and given
the power a big-money
in the political process in general they
understand
that their pain is not being
heard washing and that people in
washington
elected official much wat concern about
the lobbyists
and the billionaire the suffering
ordinary
now combat ng this political
alienation this it is and this
legitimate
angle will not be easy that's for sure
but that is exactly
what gavel we machst du
if we're going to turn this country
around
and that is what this campaign is all
about
and if we are going to bring people
together
we need a simple straightforward
progressive agenda which speaks to the
need
up the American people and provide
software
a vision are they very different America
and what his father John let me briefly
tell you when I think the agenda begins
with
job job and more jobs if we are serious
about reversing the client the middle
class
we need a may drop federal jobs program
which put millions of people back to
work
a good paying jobs at a time when our
roads our bridges
our water system rail and airport of the
caning
about the fact that way to rapidly
create
meaningful jobs is to rebuild our
crumbling
infrastructure
and that is why I
introduce legislation which would at
best one trillion dollars over five
years
to modernize our country's physical
infrastructure of legislation that would
create
and maintain third she million
good-paying jobs
and if you're president
I will lead the effort to make sure what
that legislation
this past I will also continue to oppose
our current trade policy what de que
presidents from both parties have
supported trade agreements which are
poor start
million up decent paying jobs as
corporate america
shot down plants in vermont throughout
this country
and moves to low-wage country as
president might trade policies
will break not cycle of agreements which
rich
but few at the expense up too many
lot of also be on earth
and acknowledge that today million
of american workers on now working poor
totally
inadequate wages the car in
federal minimum wage up seven and a
quarter now are
is a start they should wage and Mark be
raised
not minimum wage in this country
marked b.com a living wage which be
which believes raising it the fifteen
dollars an hour
over the next few years old
our goal
not a radical idea when our goal must be
that any worker
in this country who worked 40 hours a
week
is not living in poverty Burgaw
we must stop large pay equity for women
workers
it is unconscionable that women earn 78
cents on the dollar
compared to men will perform the same
work
we must also revived our
overtime standards so that people
people make it 25 with 30,000 now 30,000
a year
who are working 50 60 hours a week
get time and a half
and and we need paid sick leave
and guaranteed vacation time for every
worker
in this country this campaign
starting today is going to send a
message
the billionaire class and that is
you can't have it all you can't get
huge tax breaks while children in this
country
go hungry you can't continue
sending out job abroad wild million
are looking for work you can't hide your
property in the Cayman Islands
and other tax havens while they are on
math look unmet needs
on every corner up this nation total
billion a class of
I save that your degree has got to end.
you cannot take advantage all of the
benefits
America up if you refuse to accept your
responsibilities
and ideas why
we need a tax system which is fair
and Progresso which counsel wealthiest
individuals
and the largest corporations that they
are going to begin
to start paying their fair share our our
taxes
when we talk about power
we talk about Wall Street in my view
it is time to break up the largest
financial institutions
in this country Wall Street cannot
continue
to be an island unto itself gambling
trillion in risky financial instruments
while expecting the public the bail in
I'll
if a bank is too big to fail that bank
is topiary
to accept
if we are serious about a progressive
agenda that speaks to the D
of working families their talks about
climate change
and the needs about kids and the elderly
we marked
be focused on campaign finance reform
and a needed break constitutional
amendment
to overturn their interest Citizens
United decision
I am said it before and I'll say it
again
I will not nominate any justice
the Supreme Court who else not made it
clear that he or she
will mu to overturn that this actress
position
which is on the binding american
democracy longer-term
we need to go further in a stylish
public funding
on election I look to our future it is
clear to me
that the United States of America month
leave the world in reversing climate
change
weekend do not
like transforming our energy system
away from fossil fuels for energy
efficiency
and thought sustainable energy use when
so solar geothermal and biomass
brothers and sisters the United States
of America today
remains the only major country on earth
but does not guarantee health care
to all people as the right
despite the modest gains of the
Affordable Care Act 35 million Americans
continue to have no health insurance
an even more are under insurer
yet despite that pathetic record
we end up spending almost twice as much
per capita on health care is any all
about
nation in March strong a pic
United States March drawing the rest of
the industrialized world
and guarantee health care to all as a
right in
and we both stored through a Medicare
for All
single-payer program
out at a time
when millions of Americans are
struggling to keep their heads above
water economically
and a time when senior poverty is
increasing
at a time when millions of kids in this
country
don't get enough food the my Republican
colleagues
as part of their recently passed budget
are trying to make
a terrible situation even worth if you
can believe it and this is the true
the republican budget rose $27 million
Americans
awkward health insurance makes drastic
cuts in Medicare
growth billion low-income Americans
including
pregnant women of good nutrition
programs
and makes it hard on stroke and makes it
horrible working-class families
to afford college or put their kids
in the head start program
and then to add insult to injury
the republican budget provides you tax
breaks
for the very richest people in this
country while they raise taxes
on working family
well let me tell my Republican
colleagues
that I respectfully disagree
with their approach %uh instead of
cutting Social Security
we are going to expand social security
card
%uh instead of cutting head start
and child care we are going to move to a
universal
pre-k system for all the children of
this country as Franklin Delano
Roosevelt reminded of
a nation's greatness is George not quite
what it provides
to the most well-off wonder how it
treats the people
most Indy and dodi is what kind of
country
we must become %uh
and when we talk about education
let me make it very clear in a highly
competitive global economy
we need the best educated workforce we
can
create it is insane it is
counterproductive
to the best interests of our country
that 100
of thousands up right young people can
not
up Lloyd to go to college and that
millions of others
leave school with a mountain of debt
that burden them
put back in
this is not what a great country it's
about
that most and not it's why I as
president well
fight to make to we're sure in in public
colleges and universities free
%uh
as well as substantially lower interest
rates one student loans
and
the young people all over our country
our book young chop
they've gotta get the education they
need %uh
as everybody knows we live in a
difficult
and dangerous world and there are people
out there
who would do us harm as president I will
defend this nation
but I will do it responsibly as a member
of congress
I voted against the war in Iraq and I
walked alright bro
%uh
I am vigorously oppose
to enlist perpetual walk in the Middle
East
yes we must be vigorous and calm banning
terrorism
and the feeding ices but we as a nation
should not
have to bear that burden alone we must
be part of an international coalition
led by the Muslim nations that could not
only to be like this
but begin the process up creating
conditions
well last week please out
as some love you know
I was born in a faraway land called
Brooklyn New York

young age
my mother graduated high school in New
York City
my father worked his entire life is a
pain
