NOW ON TO THE SOUTH AND WEST.
[APPLAUSE]
[CHEERS]
MR. SANDERS: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, NEW HAMPSHIRE.
[APPLAUSE]
SHORTLY AFTER THE POLLS CLOSED,
SECRETARY CLINTON CALLED AND WAS
VERY GRACIOUS IN HER
CONGRATULATIONS.
I THANK HER FOR HER CALL.
I CONGRATULATE HER AND HER
SUPPORTERS FOR THE VIGOROUS
CAMPAIGN THEY RAN IN NEW
HAMPSHIRE.
LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO
THANK THE MANY, MANY THOUSANDS
OF VOLUNTEERS HERE IN THE
GRANITE STATE WHO WORKED SO
TIRELESSLY.
[APPLAUSE]
OUR VOLUNTEERS WORKED NIGHT AND
DAY, MADE PHONE CALLS AND KNOCK
ON A LOT OF DOORS.
[APPLAUSE]
AND WE WON BECAUSE OF YOUR
ENERGY.
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.
I WANT TO THANK JULIA BARNES AND
OUR GREAT CAMPAIGN STAFF.
[APPLAUSE]
TOGETHER, WE HAVE SENT A MESSAGE
THAT WILL ECHO FROM WALL STREET
TO WASHINGTON, FROM MAINE TO
CALIFORNIA.
AND THAT IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT
OF OUR GREAT COUNTRY BELONGS TO
ALL OF THE PEOPLE AND NOT JUST A
HANDFUL OF WEALTHY
CAMPAIGN
CONTRIBUTORS AND THEIR SUPER
PACS.
[APPLAUSE]
NINE MONTHS AGO, WE BEGAN OUR
CAMPAIGN HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
WE HAD NO CAMPAIGN
ORGANIZATION.
WE HAD NO MONEY AND WE WERE
TAKING ON THE MOST POWERFUL
POLITICAL ORGANIZATION IN THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
TONIGHT, WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE
A RECORD-BREAKING VOTER TURNOUT
--
[APPLAUSE]
BECAUSE OF A HUGE VOTER TURNOUT
-- AND I SAY HUGE.
WE WON
BECAUSE WE HARNESSED THE
ENERGY AND THE EXCITEMENT THAT
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WILL NEED
TO SUCCEED IN NOVEMBER.
[APPLAUSE]
WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN NEW
HAMPSHIRE IN TERMS
OF AN
ENTHUSIASTIC AND AROUSED
ELECTORATE, PEOPLE CAME OUT IN
LARGE NUMBERS, THAT IS WHAT WILL
HAPPEN ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY
.
LET'S NEVER FORGET
THEM --
DEMOCRATS AND PROGRESSIVES WIN
WHEN VOTER TURNOUT IS HIGH.
REPUBLICANS WIN WHEN PEOPLE ARE
DEMORALIZED AND VOTER TURNOUT IS
LOW.
TONIGHT, WE SERVE
NOTICE TO THE
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC
ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS COUNTRY
THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL
NOT CONTINUE TO ACCEPT A
CORRUPT
CAMPAIGN FINANCE SYSTEM THAT IS
UNDERMINING AMERICAN DEMOCRACY
AND WE WILL NOT ACCEPT A RIGGED
ECONOMY IN WHICH ORDINARY
AMERICANS WORK LONGER HOURS FOR
LOWER WAGES WHILE ALMOST ALL NEW
INCOME AND WEALTH GOES TO THE
TOP 1%.
[APPLAUSE]
I WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY
AGAIN TO CONGRATULATE SECRETARY
CLINTON IN HER -- AND WERE
ORGANIZATION AND SUPPORTERS FOR
WAGING A VIGOROUS CAMPAIGN.
I HOPE IN THE DAYS AGAIN --
AHEAD, WE CAN CONTINUE TO WAGE A
STRONG ISSUE ORIENTED CAMPAIGN
AND BRING NEW PEOPLE INTO THE
POLITICAL PROCESS.
BUT I ALSO HOPE THAT WE ALL
REMEMBER
AND THIS IS A MESSAGE
NOT JUST TO OUR OPPONENTS BUT TO
THOSE WHO SUPPORT ME AS WELL,
THAT WE WILL NEED TO COME
TOGETHER IN A FEW MONTHS AND
UNITE THIS PARTY AND THIS NATION
BECAUSE THE RIGHT WING
REPUBLICANS WE OPPOSE MUST NOT
BE ALLOWED TO GAIN THE
PRESIDENCY.
[APPLAUSE]
AS WE ALL REMEMBER, THE LAST
TIME REPUBLICANS OCCUPIED THE
WHITE HOUSE, THEIR TRICKLE-DOWN
ECONOMIC POLICIES DROVE US INTO
THE WORST ECONOMIC DOWNTURN
SINCE THE DEPRESSION OF THE
1930'S.
NO, WE WILL NOT ALLOW
HUGE TAX
BREAKS FOR BILLIONAIRES.
WE WILL NOT ALLOW
HUGE CUTS TO
SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE,
MEDICAID AND EDUCATION.
[APPLAUSE]
NO, WE WILL NOT ALLOW BACK INTO
THE WHITE HOUSE A POLITICAL
PARTY WHICH IS SO BOLD
EHOLDEN
TO THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY THAT
THEY CANNOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE
SCIENTIFIC REALITY OF CLIMATE
CHANGE.
[APPLAUSE]
THE PEOPLE OF NEW
HAMPSHIRE HAVE
SENT A PROFOUND MESSAGE TO THE
POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT, TO THE
ECONOMIC ESTABLISHMENT AND, BY
THE WAY, THE MEDIA
ESTABLISHMENT.
[APPLAUSE]
BERNIE, BERNIE, BERNIE,
BERNIE, BERNIE.
MR.
SANDERS: WHAT THE PEOPLE
HERE HAVE SAID IS THAT GIVEN THE
ENORMOUS CRISES FACING OUR
COUNTRY, IT IS JUST TOO LATE FOR
THE SAME OLD, SAME OLD
ESTABLISHMENT POLITICS AND
ESTABLISHMENT ECONOMICS.
THE PEOPLE WANT REAL CHANGE.
[APPLAUSE]
WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
SAYING -- BY THE WAY, I HEAR IT
IS NOT JUST FROM PROGRESSIVES
BUT FROM CONSERVATIVES AND FROM
MODERATES, IS THAT WE CAN NO
LONGER CONTINUE TO HAVE A
CAMPAIGN FINANCE SYSTEM IN WHICH
WALL STREET AND THE BILLIONAIRE
CLASS ARE ABLE TO BUY ELECTIONS.
[APPLAUSE]
AMERICANS, AMERICANS NO MATTER
WHAT THEIR POLITICAL VIEW MAY BE
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS NOT WHAT
DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT.
THAT IS WHAT A LA DARK HE IS
ABOUT -- IS ABOUT.
WE WILL NOT ALLOW THAT TO
CONTINUE.
[APPLAUSE]
I DO NOT HAVE A SUPER PAC AND I
DO NOT WANT A SUPER PAC.
[APPLAUSE]
I AM OVERWHELMED AND I AM DEEPLY
MOVED FAR MORE THAN I CAN
EXPRESS IN WORDS BY THE FACT
THAT OUR CAMPAIGN
S'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT COMES FROM
MORE THAN ONE MILLION AMERICANS
WHO HAVE MADE OF MORE THAN $3.7
MILLION
IN INDIVIDUAL
CONTRIBUTIONS.
[APPLAUSE]
THAT IS MORE INDIVIDUAL
CONTRIBUTIONS THAN ANY CANDIDATE
IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED
STATES UP UNTIL THIS POINT IN AN
ELECTION.
[APPLAUSE]
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT AVERAGE
CONTRIBUTION WAS?
$27.
[APPLAUSE]
I AM GOING TO NEW YORK CITY
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW.
BUT, I'M NOT GOING TO NEW YORK
CITY TO HOLD A FUNDRAISER ON
WALL STREET.
INSTEAD, I'M GOING TO
HOLD A
FUNDRAISER RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW
ACROSS AMERICA.
MY REQUEST
IS PLEASE GO TO
BERNIESANDERS.COM AND
CONTRIBUTE.
PLEASE HELP US RAISE THE FUNDS
WE NEED WHETHER IT IS $10 OR
$20
OR $50, HELP US RAISE THE MONEY
WE NEED TO TAKE THE FIGHT TO
NEVADA, SOUTH CAROLINA
AND THE
STATE ON SUPER TUESDAY.
THERE IT IS.
THAT IS OUR FUNDRAISER.
WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND IS OUR GREAT COUNTRY
WAS BASED ON A SIMPLE PRINCIPLE
AND THAT PRINCIPLE IS FAIRNESS.
LET ME BE VERY
CLEAR -- IT IS
NOT FAIR WHEN WE HAVE MORE
INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY
TODAY THAN ALMOST ANY MAJOR
COUNTRY ON EARTH AND WHEN THE
TOP 1/10 OF 1% NOW OWNS ALMOST
AS MUCH WEALTH AS THE BOTTOM
90%.
THAT IS NOT FAIR.
IT IS NOT FAIR WHEN THE 20TH
WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THIS
COUNTRY NOW OWN MORE WEALTH THAN
THE BOTTOM HALF THAN THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
ARE YOU GUYS READY FOR A RADICAL
IDEA?
TOGETHER, WE ARE GOING TO CREATE
IN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF
US, NOT JUST THE 1%.
[APPLAUSE]
AND WHEN MILLIONS OF OUR PEOPLE
ARE WORKING WITH STARVATION
WAGES, YES, WE ARE GOING TO
RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO $50 AN
HOUR.
-- $15 AN HOUR.
AND WE ARE GOING TO BRING PAY
EQUITY FOR WOMEN.
[APPLAUSE]
AND WHEN WE NEED THE BEST
EDUCATED WORKFORCE IN THE WORLD,
YES, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE PUBLIC
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES
TUITION FREE.
AND FOR THE MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS STRUGGLING WITH
HORRENDOUS LEVELS OF STUDENT
DEBT WE ARE GOING TO EASE THAT
BURDEN.
[APPLAUSE]
IN AMERICA, PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE
FINANCIALLY DISTRESSED FOR
DECADES FOR THE CRIME OF TRYING
TO GET A HIGHER EDUCATION.
THAT IS ABSURD.
MY CRITICS SAY THAT IS A GREAT
IDEA.
YOU ARE INTO THIS GREAT STUFF,
HOW WILL YOU PAY FOR IT?
I WILL TELL YOU HOW.
WE WILL IMPOSE A TAX ON WALL
STREET SPECULATION.
THE
GREED DROVE OUR ECONOMY TO
ITS KNEES.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BAILED OUT
WALL STREET.
NOW IT IS WALL STREET'S TIME TO
HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS
.
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRANSFORMING
AMERICA, IT MEANS
ENDING THAT
HIS OF THIS COUNTRY HAVING MORE
PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN ANY OTHER
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
DISPROPORTIONATELY
AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO.
NOT ONLY ARE WE GOING TO FIGHT
TO END INSTITUTIONAL RACISM
AND
A BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
--
[APPLAUSE]
WE ARE GOING TO
PROVIDE JOBS AND
EDUCATION FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE,
NOT JAILS AND INCARCERATION.
THE DEBATE IS OVER, CLIMATE
CHANGE IS REAL.
IT IS CAUSED BY HUMAN ACTIVITY
AND IT IS ALREADY CAUSING
DEVASTATING PROBLEMS IN THIS
COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD.
WE HAVE A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY
TO WORK WITH COUNTRIES
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO
TRANSFORM OUR ENERGY SYSTEM AWAY
FROM FOSSIL FUELS TO ENERGY
EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABLE
ENERGY.
[APPLAUSE]
NOW I HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED
DURING THIS CAMPAIGN FOR MANY,
MANY THINGS.
EVERY SINGLE
DAY, THAT IS OK,
THAT IS ALL RIGHT.
THEY ARE THROWING EVERYTHING AT
ME EXCEPT THE KITCHEN SINK AND I
HAVE THE FEELING THAT KITCHEN
SINK IS COMING PRETTY SOON AS
WELL.
WHAT ARE CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT IS
THINKING BIG, NOT SMALL.
IT IS ABOUT HAVING THE COURAGE
TO REJECT THE STATUS QUO.
[APPLAUSE]
IT IS ABOUT SAYING THERE IS A
TIME WHEN EVERY MAJOR COUNTRY ON
EARTH DURING TIMES HEALTH CARE
-- GUARANTEES HEALTH CARE TO ALL
OF ITS PEOPLE, WE SHOULD BE
DOING THE SAME IN OUR GREAT
COUNTRY.
IN MY VIEW UNDER PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S LEADERSHIP, BEFORE THE
CARE ACT HAS BEEN -- THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS BEEN AN
IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD, BUT WE
CAN AND MUST DO BETTER.
[APPLAUSE]
29 MILLION AMERICANS SHOULD NOT
REMAIN UNINSURED AND AN EVEN
GREATER NUMBER SHOULD NOT BE
UNDERINSURED WITH LARGE
DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYMENTS.
WE SHOULD NOT BE PAYING
BY FAR
THE HIGHEST PRICES IN THE WORLD
FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS -- LISTEN
TO THIS -- AT A TIME WHEN THE
TOP THREE DRUG COMPANIES IN THIS
COUNTRY MAKE $45 BILLION IN
PROFITS LAST YEAR.
[BOOING]
THAT IS AN OBSCENITY.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING --
WHEN WE MAKE IT TO THE WHITE
HOUSE.
[APPLAUSE]
WHEN WE MAKE IT TO THE WHITE
HOUSE, THE PHARMACEUTICAL
INDUSTRY WILL NOT CONTINUE TO
RIP OFF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
IT MAKES NO SENSE AS A NATION,
WE CONTINUE TO SPEND FAR MORE
PER CAPITAL -- OR CAPITA -- PER
CAPITA THAN ANY
OTHER NATION
THAT GUARANTEES HEALTH CARE TO
ALL OF THEIR PEOPLE AND THAT IS
WHY I BELIEVE IN MEDICARE FOR
ALL SINGLE-PAYER PROGRAMS.
[APPLAUSE]
WHICH WILL NOT ONLY
GUARANTEE
HEALTH CARE FOR ALL, BUT WILL
SAVE THE AVERAGE MIDDLE-CLASS
FAMILY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A
YEAR IN HEALTH CARE COSTS.
[APPLAUSE]
MY FRIENDS, WE ALL
KNOW THAT WE
LIVE IN A DANGEROUS AND COMPLEX
WORLD.
AS PRESIDENT, I WILL DEFEND THIS
NATION BUT I WILL DO IT
RESPONSIBLY.
[APPLAUSE]
I VOTED AGAINST THE WAR IN
IRAQ.
[APPLAUSE]
AND THAT WAS THE RIGHT VOTE.
WHILE WE MUST BE PRESENT --
RELENTLESS IN COMBATING
TERRORISTS WHO WILL DO US HARM,
WE CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT BE THE
POLICEMAN OF THE WORLD.
[APPLAUSE]
NOR SHOULD WE BEAR
THE BURDEN OF
FIGHTING TERRORISM ALONE.
IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THE UNITED
STATES MUST BE PART OF AN
INTERNATIONAL COALITION
SUSTAINED BY NATIONS IN THE
REGION THAT HAVE THE MEANS TO
PROTECT THEMSELVES.
TOGETHER, WE MUST AND WILL
DESTROY ISIS, BUT WE MUST DO IT
IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT PUT OUR
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN THE
MILITARY INTO PERPETUAL WARFARE
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
[APPLAUSE]
MY
FRIENDS, WE MUST FIX OUR
BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT
DIVIDES FAMILIES AND CREATE A
PATH TOWARDS CITIZENSHIP FOR
HARD-WORKING PEOPLE THAT ARE
LIVING IN THE SHADOWS.
[APPLAUSE]
WE MUST STRENGTHEN
AND EXPAND
SOCIAL SECURITY AND INCREASE THE
BENEFITS THAT SENIORS AND
DISABLED VETERANS RECEIVE SO
THAT PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN DIGNITY.
[APPLAUSE]
WE
MUST REBUILD OUR CRUMBLING
INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHEN WE DO
THAT, WE CREATE MILLIONS OF
DECENT PAYING JOBS.
WE MUST PURSUE THE FIGHT FOR
WOMEN'S RIGHTS, GAY RIGHTS, FOR
DISABILITY RIGHTS.
[APPLAUSE]
WE MUST AGAIN STRONGER
OPPOSITION OR CHECK THE RIGHT OF
A WOMAN TO CONTROL HER OWN BODY.
[APPLAUSE]
AND WE MUST PROTECT THE MEN AND
WOMEN WHO SERVE OUR NATION IN
UNIFORM AND PROTECT OUR VETERANS
WHO PUT THEIR LIFE ON THE LINE
TO DEFEND US.
[APPLAUSE]
MY FRIENDS, WE MUST HOLD THE
BILLIONAIRE CLASS AND THE 1%
THAT THEY CANNOT HAVE IT ALL AT
A TIME OF MASSIVE WEALTH AND
INCOME INEQUALITY.
THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE
AND
LARGEST CORPORATIONS IN THIS
COUNTRY WILL START PAYING THEIR
FAIR SHARE OF TAXES.
[APPLAUSE]
MY FRIENDS, I AM THE SON OF A
POLISH IMMIGRANT WHO CAME TO
THIS COUNTRY SPEAKING NO ENGLISH
AND HAVING NO MONEY.
MY FATHER WORKED EVERY DAY OF
HIS LIFE AND HE NEVER MADE A
WHOLE LOT.
MY MOM AND DAD
-- MY BROTHER AND
I GREW UP IN A SMALL
RENT-CONTROLLED APARTMENT IN
BROOKLYN, NEW YORK.
MY MOTHER WHO DIED AT A YOUNG
AGE ALWAYS DREAMED OF MOVING OUT
OF THAT APARTMENT, GETTING A
HOME OF OUR OWN, BUT YOU NEVER
REALIZED THAT DREAM.
THE TRUTH IS NEITHER ONE
COULD
HAVE DREAMED I WOULD BE YEAR
TONIGHT -- HERE TONIGHT STANDING
BEFORE YOU AS A CANDIDATE FOR
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[APPLAUSE]
BERNIE, BERNIE, BERNIE,
BERNIE, BERNIE, BERNIE, BERNIE.
MR. SANDERS: THIS IS THE PROMISE
OF AMERICA AND THIS IS THE
PROMISE WE MUST KEEP ALIVE FOR
FUTURE GENERATIONS.
WHAT BEGAN LAST WEEK IN IOWA,
WHAT VOTERS HERE IN NEW
HAMPSHIRE CONFIRMED TONIGHT IS
NOTHING SHORT OF THE BEGINNING
OF A POLITICAL REVOLUTION.
[APPLAUSE]
IT IS A POLITICAL REVOLUTION
THAT WILL BRING TENS OF MILLIONS
OF OUR PEOPLE TOGETHER.
PEOPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN UP ON THE
POLITICAL PROCESS.
IT WILL BRING TOGETHER YOUNG
PEOPLE WHO HAD NEVER
PARTICIPATED IN THE POLITICAL
PROCESS.
IT WILL BRING TOGETHER
BLACKS
AND WHITES,
ASIAN-AMERICANS, NATIVE
AMERICANS.
FEMALE.
AND PEOPLE WHO IMMIGRATED HERE.
[APPLAUSE]
WE WILL
ALL COME TOGETHER TO SAY
LOUDLY AND CLEARLY THAT THE
GOVERNMENT OF OUR GREAT NATION
BELONGS TO ALL OF US NOT JUST A
FEW WEALTHY CAMPAIGN
CONTRIBUTORS.
[APPLAUSE]
THAT IS WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS
ABOUT.
THAT IS WHAT THE POLITICAL
REVOLUTION IS ABOUT, SO NEW
HAMPSHIRE, THANK YOU AGAIN.
AND NOW, IT IS ON --
[APPLAUSE]
