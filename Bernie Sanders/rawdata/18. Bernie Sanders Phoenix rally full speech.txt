thank you

the
thank you
you know we have heard we have had
large turnouts in Wisconsin
in Colorado this is the largest turnout
the
are the
the
there are a lot of people here
you know when we were coming to Arizona
somebody said Arizona
is a conservator stay what they talkin
somebody told me that people are given
up
on the political process not what I see
a
tonight the
thank you all so much
I cannot believe this crowd I just one
of thank you so much
the company
of the president's you are incredible
practices here
tonight gives me hope and gives people
all over this country hope
that when we stand together when we come
together
in meetings like this there is nothing
that we cannot
accomplish a transforming America the
and i wanna thank you land of for that
wonderful introduction
she's a member of the CW a and I thank
the CW way
have a trade union movement this country
what this campaign
is about is pretty simple what this
campaign is about
is saying that our great country
an hour government belong to all the
people
and not a handful billionaires the
well i wont to do tonight is to do
something that we
to rally to and that is just lay on the
table
the important issues facing our country
and determine how we can go forward
so that government represents all of us
and addresses the serious problems that
we face
and the first issue the first issue
well i wont to put on the table
is the issue of income
and wealth inequality the
today
we live in eighty nation
which has more income and more wealth
any quality than any other major country
on earth
that is not acceptable it's a gap of we
are gonna change not
the
if you think about it for a moment
you recognize that the issue
loving Commonwealth inequality is a
moral issue
all we could sense
the perry did finish the sentence
all week concerns to seeing a
proliferation
%uh millionaires and billionaires what
we have the highest rate of childhood
poverty
have any major country on earth
it is a moral issue but it is an
economic issue as well because
our economy can not do well
when so few have so much and so many
have so little the
my Republican friends think that the
CEOs of large corporations
on the job creators you know
do you know who the job creators of you
are the job creators
the
and when working people have money in
their pocket
they go out and they buy goods today by
services
and when they do that they create jobs
but when millions of people
have nothing to spend we are not
creating
the jobs that we need
and that is why I believe that what our
economics should be about is putting
money
it to the hands of working people and
not
the billionaires the
brothers and sisters there is something
profoundly wrong when the top
one to ban of 1 percent own
almost as much wealth as the bottom
ninety percent
there is something profoundly wrong
when in the last several years
fifty-eight percent
all new income created has gone
to the top one percent
there is something profoundly wrong
when one family one family the owners a
Walmart
own more well on the bottom
40 percent up the American people
this grotesque level of income and
wealth
any quality is bad economics
it is unsustainable and it is not what
the United States of America
is supposed to be about the
and we have a message tonight
to the billionaire class
and that message is you cannot
how did all the
you cannot cure huge tax breaks
where children in Vermont then Arizona
go hungry
you cannot could continue to to ship our
jobs to China
when millions of Americans need work
here
the
you cannot hide
your profits your billions in profits in
the Cayman Islands
and other tax havens when we have on
Matt needs that america
that box be address the
and what we are saying to the
billionaire class
is they agree has got tired
and we are gonna dead followed up the
what it is not charged
the grotesque an embarrassing love
11.com
and wealth inequality when we talk about
what's going on in america today
we have gone to recognize the tragic
reality
that for the last 40 yeah it's not ten
years
not twenty book for the last forty years
the great middle-class
of this country once the envy of the
entire world
that middle-class has been disappearing
and I want you to think about this all
love you know now we have seen in recent
years an explosion
up technology and work of productivity
and yet despite that median family
income today
is almost five thousand dollars lasts
that it was in 1999
all over america all over America all
over our great country
people are working not just one job not
just two jobs they're working three jobs
for jobs to cobble together some income
and some health care this economy can do
and much too better than that
let me say a word
about on employment once a month you
read the official unemployment
results coming from
the government and they tell you that
official unemployment is 5.3 percent
but what they don't tell you is if you
look at another government statistic
which includes those people have given
of looking for work
and those people who are working
part-time you know everybody working
part-time
when I want to work full time when UN
although back together real unemployment
is 10 .5 per side and let me tell you
something apps
that we all most noble the scars
and that is the tragedy abused
unemployment in this country
a recent study came out recent study
came out
looking at kids who graduated high
school
and this is what it said if those kids
were whites their real unemployment rate
was thirty
3 percent if they were Hispanic
their unemployment rate was thirty
six-percent
if they were african-american their
unemployment rate was 51 per side
and let me tell you something else in
america today
we have more people in jail than any
other country on earth
that's right
and one of the reasons aside from
a broken criminal justice system
one of the reasons that we have so many
people
in jail is that we have five and a half
million kids
hanging out on street corners with no
jobs
and no education
and it seems to me to make
a lot more sense to invest
in education and jobs for our kids
rather go to jail
credit card for richer the
i wont our country to have the best
educated
people more people going to college than
any other country
not more people jail than any other
country
the
and when we talk about the economy it's
not just income and wealth inequality
it's not just high unemployment is low
low wages all over our country in my
state in your state you got people work
in 40-50 hours a week
not earning the money they need to feed
their families
or put a few books in the back in
washington the federal minimum wage
is seven dollars and twenty five cents
an hour
brothers and sisters 725
is a starvation wage
we have got to talk we have got to raise
the minimum wage
to a living wage 50 bucks an hour
the
I don't think it is a radical idea to
say
there is somebody works 40 hours a week
that person should not be living in
poverty
that's what america should be
and when we talk about fair wages
we also have to understand that it is
unacceptable that women today
make 78 cents on the dollar compared to
the
brothers we have got to stand with our
system is
and fight for pay equity for women
workers
now is
many of you know a lot of my republican
colleagues
you know what they stand for well let me
tell you what they stand for
summer what these what
are republican colleagues talk about
of family values are real talk about
family values
and this is what damian
by family values they mean that a woman
should not be able and have the right
to control her own body I get some great
day believe that women
if you can believe this should not be
able to purchase
the contraceptives they wont
and they believe that our gay brothers
and sisters
should not have the right to marry
those Aug now family values
goes on not our family values
but let me tell you well I think
family values should be real family
values
that support families that enable
love to exist can to exist in families
first we have doctor ends the
international embarrassment
up the United States being the only
major country on earth which does not
guarantee
workers paid medical and family leave
today in Arizona
today in vermont a woman
is giving birth if that woman has
ample income she will be able to stay
home
and the father will be able to stay home
with that baby
to get to bond with their baby to get
the love that baby to get to know that
baby
in perhaps one of the most important
moments
in a family's like but if that woman
does not have adequate income she will
be forced to go back to work
in three days five days seven days
is not a family value that is
that is exactly the opposite a1 a family
value was not as wide
I will fight for and bring about 12
weeks of paid
family and medical the
all over this country
that's right
all over this country we have working
people
thing when they get sick they go to work
and they go to work because they have no
guaranteed
sick time it's time to end not they
provide guaranteed paid
sick time for every worker in america
you know I think we all heard a few
weeks ago that
jeb bush thinks that the american people
jeb bush leagues the American people
need to work
a little bit hard
Worli obviously didn't heal the sad
reality
that the american people already work
the longest hours %uh any major
country on earth our people do not need
to work longer hours
they need hi all wagers and better a job
now when we talk about
the crises facing
our country when pollsters asked people
what's on your mind
what do you think is most important what
people invariably say is
jobs we need more jobs
well in my view when we have over 30
percent
youth unemployment ten and a half
percent unemployment in general
when our infrastructure our roads
bridges water systems rail
are crumbling we can and should
put millions of people back to work
rebuilding
how crumbling infrastructure
hired introduce legislation that would
put a trillion dollars into our roads
and bridges
which would create up to third see
million jobs
and that is exactly
what we have to do think up in america
where all over this country
our people are rebuilding our slippers
now far behind many other countries
lets her out the best rail system in the
world
but what are people to work doing
and when we talk about creating jobs
we also have to talk about stopping the
loss of jobs
because about disastrous trade policies
you're looking at a senator who voted
against nafta
again after the
against permanent normal trade relations
with China and is leading the opposition
to this disastrous trade TPP
trade again
we need trade policies
which create jobs in on america
we did corporate America to start
investing
in america and not just countries all
over the world
now when we talk
when we talk about what's going on in
this country
but we talk about greed when we talk
about
recklessness when we talk about illegal
behavior
these are John some other words that we
use to describe
Wall Street
today Lee largest
6 financial institutions in this country
have assets absorb 10 trillion dollars
acquittal in the sixty percent to the
GDP
of America
after we bailed them out because
they were too big to fail most to them
%uh now a lot bigger than they were
before we bail them out
in my view if a financial institution
should
is too big to fail it is too big
28 cents
and that is why I have introduced
legislation
to break these huge financial
institutions up
now wanna talk very briefly
about an issue which in many ways
maybe more important then any
other and that is that is a result
of the disastrous Supreme Court decision
in the Citizens United case
the American political system has been
totally corrupted
and the foundations of American
democracy
lobbying undermines
what the supreme court said
to the wealthiest people in our country
they said okay guys
you already own much should the economy
we're now going to give you the
opportunity
to all alone the United States
government and that is what they are
trying to do
in this campaign the Koch brothers on
low
the snack 10 wealthiest family in
America
will be spending almost a billion
dollars
in this campaign cycle that is more
money
then I for the Democratic or Republican
Party's
on spending when one family spends more
money than either of the two major
political parties that is not democracy
bodies I look cokie
and that is why we have got to overturn
Citizens United
and why do we need public funding
other elections
i wont I see a lot of young people here
today
the
in our ward our young people to be able
to
run for office if they want to do and
not have to big money
for the rich and the powerful to dole
out
and now that we have a lot of young
people here let me mention another issue
a bit bored and so are you right now
all love you know that we live as a
nation in a highly competitive
global economy and if we are going to
succeed into the future
we need the best educated workforce
in the world
at this moment if you can believe that
this is how crazy it is
there are hundreds of thousands albright
hard-working qualified young people
for unable to get a college education
not because they don't have the ability
but because their family
does it how the money
so 13th Ramon but what it means the sum
kid
some low-income kids a working-class kid
who wants to make it into the middle
class
but can't go to college because his
family
lacks the funds that's wrong and that is
why
I have introduced legislation and will
fight for his president
to make every public collagen university
in America
to your kid great the
and I want you I want you to think for a
moment
I want you to think for a moment what
free public college
and three public university will mean
what it will be what it will be is not
only
helping kids was seniors or juniors in
high school
what it will tell kids in the fourth
grade in the sixth grade
here in Phoenix or Burlington Vermont
that no matter
how poor you may be if you study hard
you do well in school you can in fact
get
all the education unique
and the other higher education the other
higher education issue that we've got to
deal with
is the absurdity %uh millions of
Americans some young good some not so
young
for carrying out regis student
debt
I may not talkin not just 50,000 on a
hundred thousand I talk to young woman
graduated dental school four hundred
thousand dollars in debt
what my legislation would do
is and the absurdity up people with
student debt
paying eight nine ten percent interest
rates
the
if you can refinance your home
at two or three percent there shouldn't
be paid
percent by Justin
and we have also Cox against the US
government
out of the business are profiteering
what's new today
the
there is
a nother issue that is up such great
importance
the Pope Francis in a recent and
cyclical
focus on it and by the way
god bless Pope Francis co-signer
the
you know I think sometimes people think
by economic views are radical
you should do with this guy is so when
he talks about money
being God modern civilization people
worshipping money
rather than their brothers in their
sisters but what he wrote about in his
recent encyclical
is what virtually the entire scientific
community is telling us
and that is that we have a moral
obligation
as adults and parents to leave
this planet to our kids and
grandchildren
in a habitable way
climate change Israel
climate change is caused by human
activity
climate change is already causing
devastating problems
in our country and all OVR the world
we must
leave the world in an extremely
aggressive way
in breaking our dependence on fossil
fuels
in movie
in moving to win so long geothermal
and other sustainable energies
and here's what the scientists tell us
they say if we do not do that
by the end of this century
this planet will be between five and ten
degrees Fahrenheit warm
and what that will mean is more droughts
more flooding more extreme weather
disturbances
more acidification of the ocean more
more international conflict
his country's fight force castle not
rule
resources we have a moral obligation
to leave the world in transforming
our energy system
and when we talk
about rights and when we talk about how
the united states and
many respects lags behind other
countries there is no
issue in which side is clear all then
the issue
Aug health care
today the United States of America
is the only major country on earth
that does not guarantee health care to
all people
as the right
together you and I are going to end
died in Paris vid because
we are gonna pass a Medicare for All
single-payer program
we can do it we can't do it healthcare
must be seen as a rights not a privilege
what we
have also got to do is we transform
America is to understand a very simple
point and I'm the only candidate for
president who will tell you this
but it is the truth and that is
no president none no matter how good he
or she may be
can bring about the changes that we need
desperately need
in this country on last there is a
political
revolution
and what that political revolution means
is that people all over america
have got to stand up and b.com
involved in the political process in a
way we have never done
before
we have got to also is part of that
revolution
have real debate on real issues which is
what I'm trying to do tonight I want you
to do me a favor I want you to talk
go out to be a zone of comfort I want
you to talk to your republican friends
and family members
now here's the boy here's a boy here's
the boy
it is one thing for the billionaire
class
to be voting republican
but there are many republicans out there
you know them these people are working
to two or three jobs
they have no health care their kids can
afford to go to college
and yet they're voting against people
who are fighting against their best
address
every single day
ask your republican friends why they
vote for folks
who want to tax breaks for billionaires
yet they want to cut Social Security
and Medicare
passcode why they're voting for people
you're gonna throw out onto the street
shut down their factories
and move their plants abroad so what we
need to do
is to create a political movement
a political movement which brings our
people
together what republicans
what republicans are very good at is not
talking about
what they really belief you have never
seen an airhead
on TV would says vote for me so I could
cut your social security
I give a tax break two billionaires
but that is exactly wat they Aug
trying to do now how do they get away
with this stuff I'll tell you how
de tocqueville i dont stop by race
by country of origin
by sexual orientation by John Doe
they say they say no whites worry about
blacks they say the native-born
Americans
worry about immigrants they say the man
worry about
women our job is not to divide
our job is to bring people together
the
and when we talk about bringing
one day should together we have got to
understand that today
in america there are any Lavigne
million people living in the shadows
people who are afraid that they could be
deported
to borrow that is wrong we need Capri
had served immigration
rOFLOL the
we a path toward citizenship
for undocumented people we need not to
be dividing families
waiting to be united families are
keeping them
together the
now in our country there is a lock
that we should be proud of we have made
significant progress
in recent years in breaking down many
barriers
up discrimination if we were sitting
here
or in your case standing here
thirty years ago and somebody said you
know I have a crazy idea I think
that may be in 2008 the United States
will have overcome
its racist history an elected
african-american to be president people
would have said that's crazy
that will happen it happen because we
overcame unlock abrasives
plotline auspey very clear while we have
overcome
a lot of racism we have come a long way
we still have
a wall on way to go
it is not acceptable
to me and I know to you that an
african-american baby a male baby born
today
if we do not change things stands 81
in four chance up being in prison
during his life
it is not acceptable to be that we have
seen
young black man walk down streets in
this country
be beaten and be killed on joycelyn
that is not acceptable boasts police
officers I was a male
I was a mayor for eight years and I
worked
with the police what it's a tough job
both cops do it well
but when a police office of breaks the
law
that office of must be held accountable
why
luxury let me conclude by saying this I
want you all to
think big knock think small
i watch youtube all appreciate that you
are living
in the wealthiest country today in the
history of the world
the wealthiest country but nobody knows
it
because all all the wealth rest in the
hands
but a few
so what we need to do is to have a
vision
where it says said well and income
become spread out in a way
then is fair what we need
to do is to have
a vision that says that every
person in this country is it I'll to
health care
as the right
that when a mom or dad goes to work
he or she knows let their kid
in a trial care center where pre-k will
get the best
quality care available
I am the former chairman
of the senate veterans committee an IRA
we'll tell you that in this country
we have a moral obligation to make sure
that every
veteran every man and woman to put their
lives on the line
to defend his country tax payer
healthcare and the benefits they do
we are not good at the fair when I go to
turn our backs
on our veterans
we are going to be a nation
and we are going to create a nation
where everyone
no matter their race their religion
their disability or their sexual
orientation
realizes the full potential other
quality
that is the birthright Americans
I
several years ago I attended a meeting
in northern Vermont
which was honoring veterans who fought
world war to end at the beginning of
that meeting somebody played a tape
video tape
booking at Franklin Delano Roosevelt on
December 8 1941
and I was the day after pearl harbor
and what roosevelt was doing that day
was the clearing mortgage dependent so
do declare war against
Hitler in Germany on that day the United
States was unprepared to fight one war
let alone two wars but in two and a half
years
because this country focus by creating
the best military in the world
produce enough to banks are the plane's
and because we do
we won that war in two and a half years
so I don't want anybody to tell me
that this country when we bought our
minds to it
cannot guarantee health care at all

of our kids

but not if this comes easy
Frederick Douglass the great
abolitionist told us
that freedom does not calm without
struggle I need you
