close relations I thank her for her call
and I congratulate her and her
supporters with a vigorous campaign
to thank the many many thousands of
volunteers here in the granite state
made phone calls and knocked on a heck
of a lot of doors energy thank you all
great campaign
we have sent the message that will echo
from Wall Street to Washington from
Maine to California
the government of our great country
belongs to all of the people and not
just a handful of wealthy campaign
contributors and they're super PACs
months ago we began our campaign here in
new hampshire we had no campaign
organization we had no money and we were
taking on the most powerful political
organization in the United States of
America with what appears to be a
record-breaking voter turnout
and are safe
August energy and the excitement that
the democratic party will need to
succeed in November
in terms of an enthusiastic and arrivals
electorate people came out in large
numbers that is what will happen all
over
Democrats and progressives win when
voter turnout is high when people are
demoralized and voter turnout is low
we serve notice to the political and
economic establishment of this country
that the american people will not
continue to accept a corrupt campaign
finances and we will not accept a rigged
economy in which ordinary Americans work
for low wages while only in Commonwealth
goes to the top one percent
take this opportunity to congratulate
Secretary Clinton and her organization
its supporters who waging a vigorous
campaign I hope that in the days ahead
we can continue to wage a strong
issue-oriented campaign and bring
we all remember and this is a message
not just to our opponents but to those
who support me as well that we will need
to come together in a few months and
unite this party and their slaves
shouldn't because the right wing
republicans we oppose must not be
allowed to gain the president
remember the last time Republicans
occupied the White House their
trickle-down economic policies drove us
into the worst economic downturn since
the depression of the nineteen thirties
though we will not allow huge tax breaks
for billionaires
packed huge cuts to Social Security
federal Medicare Medicaid and education
back into the white house a political
party which is sold the whole to the
fossil fuel industry that they cannot
even acknowledge the scientific reality
of climate change
Hampshire have sent a profound message
to the political establishment economic
establishment and by the way to the
media establishment
same old establishment politics and
establishment economics people want real
change
I hear this not just for progressives
but for conservatives and moderates is
that we can no longer continue to have a
campaign finance system in which wall
street and the billionaire class are
able to buy elections
political view maybe understand that
that is not what democracy is about that
is what I'm talking about
we will allow them to continue
and I do not want a superclass
overwhelms I am deeply moved from more
than I can express in words by the fact
that our campaigns financial support
comes from more than one million
Americans have made more than three
point seven million individual
contributions
than any candidate in the history of the
United States
up until this point it election
average contribution was seven
going tonight
city to hold a fundraiser on wall street
I'm going to hold a fundraiser right
here right now
across America please go to Bernie
Sanders dot com and contribute
raise the funds we need whether it's 10
bucks or twenty bucks or 50 bucks how
was raised the money we need to take the
fight to South Carolina and the stakes
pretty quick
American people understand is that our
great country was based on a simple
principle and that principle various let
me be very clear it is not fair when we
have more income and wealth inequality
today that almost any major country on
earth and when the top one-tenth of one
percent now almost as much well as the
bottom 90% that's not so
20 wealthiest people in this country now
own more wealth than the bottom half of
the american people
ready for a radical idea and economy
and when they should wages we've got a
raise
yes we are going to make public colleges
and universities 23
of Americans struggling with horrendous
levels of student debt we are going to
substantially ease the burden
people should not be financially
distressed for decades for the crime the
crime of trying to get higher education
that's absurd
my critics say you know bernie is a
great idea until all this free stuff how
you're going to pay for it I will tell
you how it go to pay for it
going to impose a tax on Wall Street
speculation
recklessly and the illegal behavior of
Wall Street
our own economy two weeks DS the
American people bailed out Wall Street
now it's wall street's time to help the
middle class
America it means ending the disgrace of
this country having more people in jail
than any other country in the world
disproportionately african-american and
Latino
are we going to fight and institutional
racism and a broken criminal justice
jobs and education for our young people
not journals and incarceration
is a member of the energy committee in
the senate and the Environmental
Committee the debate is over climate
change is real
and it is already causing devastating
problems in this country and around the
world we have a moral responsibility to
work with countries throughout the world
to transform our energy system away from
fossil fuel to energy efficiency and
sustainable energy
criticized during this campaign for many
many things every single day that's ok
it's alright throwing everything at me
except the kitchen sink and I have the
feeling that kitchen see is coming
pretty soon as well
is thinking big not small it's about
having the courage to reject the status
quo
when every major country on earth
guarantees healthcare to all of their
people we should be doing the same in
our great country President Obama's
leadership the Affordable Care Act has
been an important step forward
no question about it but we can and must
do that and even greater with large
deductibles and co-payments we should
not be paying by fall the highest prices
in the world for prescription drugs at a
time
listen to this when the top three drug
companies in this country made 45
billion dollars in profit last year
and let me tell you something when we
make it to the white house
pharmaceutical industry will continue to
report we continue to spend far from
capitol then do the people of any other
nation all of whom guarantee health care
to all of the people and that is why I
believe in a Medicare for All
single-payer program
but will save the average middle-class
family thousands of dollars a year in
health care costs friends we all know
that we live in a dangerous and complex
world as President I will defend this
nation but I will do it responsibly i
voted against the war in Iraq
go right
votes
combating terrorists who would do us
home we cannot and should not be the
policeman of the world should we bear
the burden of fighting terrorism alone
in the middle east United States must be
part of an international coalition
sustained by nations in the region there
have the means to protect themselves
together we must it will destroy Isis
what we should do it in a way that does
not good
our young men and women in the military
into perpetual warfare in the quiet
fix our broken immigration system that
divides families and create a path
toward citizenship
hard-working people
and that's received so that people can
live in dignity
crumbling infrastructure and when we do
that we create millions of decent paying
jobs pursue the fight for women's rights
for gay rights for disability rights
stronger and stronger opposition protect
the right of a woman to control our own
body
protect the men and women who serve our
nation in uniform and protect our
veterans to defend
we must tell the billionaire class in
the 1% that they cannot have it all at a
time of massive wealth and income
inequality the wealthiest people and
largest corporations in this country
will start paying their fair share of
taxes
I am the son of a Polish immigrants came
to this country speaking no English and
having no money
my father worked every day of his life a
whole lot my mom and dad and brother I
grew up in a small three and a half room
rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn
New York always dream of moving out of
that apartment getting a home of our own
but you never realize the truth is that
neither one of my parents could ever
dream would be here tonight
standing before you as a candidate for
president of the United States
and this is the promise we must keep
alive for future generations what began
last week along with voters here in new
hampshire confirm tonight is nothing
short of the beginning of a political
revolution
of our people together it will bring
together working people given up on the
political process it will bring young
people in the political process he knows
Asian Americans Native Americans
female and people who immigrated here
and clearly that the government of our
songs to all of us not just a few
wealthy campaign contributors this
campaign is about that is what the
political revolution is about solo
Hampshire thank you again and now it's
odd
