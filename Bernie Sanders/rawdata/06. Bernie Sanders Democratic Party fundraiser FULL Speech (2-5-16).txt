doing what is a difficult thing to do
and that is to spend considerable
amounts of time and energy trying to
make this country a better place in
which to live and work thank you all
also say to every person in this room
that all our worst we are a hundred
times better than any of the republican
candidates are the best
say a special thanks to the many
thousands of volunteers who have worked
so hard on our campaign
we started this campaign quite fall
behind with your help we have made great
progress and I appreciate all that you
have done
also want to thank the many unions and
organizations too many to name for their
support
many others the Communication Workers of
America United Nurses United and the
American Postal Workers Union Hampshire
State Employees Association
for their support and many other
grassroots organization our campaign has
had a great deal of energy and
enthusiasm and I think the reasons are
pretty obvious we are talking about the
issues let working families and the
middle class are concerned about we are
talking about ending a corrupt campaign
finance system
american democracy is not about Wall
Street and billion as buying elections
american democracy is about one person
one vote that's what the winglet is
about
promise I made to every person in this
arena if elected president no nominee to
the supreme court will get that position
unless he or she is very clear they will
vote to overturn Citizens United
we will address rigged economy that so
many of working people are suffering on
the right now
it is not acceptable to me that at the
same time as we have the highest rate of
childhood poverty of any major country
on earth we also higher income and
wealth inequality that any other major
country on earth to the billionaire
class we are going to create an economy
that works for working families not just
the people on trial
elected president we are going to raise
the minimum wage to a living wage $15
and grace of women make in 79 cents on
the dollar compared to that
and we will pay equity for women workers
in this country
to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure
and create millions of decent paying
jobs trade disastrous trade system and
we are going to tell corporate America
start investing in this country not just
in China
we are going to say that public colleges
and universities should be questioned
three
I want every child in this country
families like mine where my mom and dad
to college I want those kids in
manchester new hampshire early to
understand to understand that if they do
their schoolwork seriously if they do
their homework and have a serious
reasons yes they will be able to get a
college education regardless of the end
of their families
and all of those people in our country
some young and some not so young people
who are now being crushed by
outrageously high levels of student debt
relief is on the way
will give we will give those millions of
people today sometimes paying twenty
twenty-five percent of their income in
student debt we are going to low
interest rates to make your debt more
bearable
senior citizens of New Hampshire many of
whom are trying to get by on eleven
twelve thirteen thousand dollars a year
in social security i understand you
understand that people can not get by on
eleven twelve thirteen thousand dollars
a year
colleagues say we should cut social
security
we should expect and social security
benefits
we are going to light lifting the cap on
taxable income
and the large multinational corporations
who continued to believe that it's okay
for them to put their billions of
dollars in profits in the Cayman Islands
and Bermuda and another tax havens we've
got news for you
going to start paying your fair share of
taxes
on wall street people whose greed and
recklessness this illegal behavior drug
this economy into the worst recession
since the nineteen thirties
bailed out by the middle class of this
country the cost of banks are too big to
fail but today in many cases are bigger
than when we bailed them out we are
going to establish a 21st century glass
six major bugs assets of almost sixty
percent of the GDP of this country
yes we are going to break up
coal industry
charges R Us highest prices in the world
for the medicine we need created a
situation in which one out of five
Americans are unable to buy the medicine
their doctors prescribe we say to them
days of raising prices off the charge
million people who are undocumented
living in the shadows earful about being
deported we say we share your pain and
we are going to pass comprehensive
immigration reform
shamefully shamefully has more people in
jail than any other country on earth we
say there will be real criminal justice
reform
education and jobs for our kids not
jails and it costs erection
we say that we are tired of seeing
people shot down by police
a police officer who breaks the law like
any other public official must be held
accountable
demilitarize local police departments
we must make police departments all
across this country look like the
diversity of the communities they serve
I have been criticized because I believe
all of our people in this great country
are entitled to health care
let me be as clear as I can I confess I
believe that health care is a right of
all people not a privilege
I believe that the Affordable Care Act
which my committee committee upon helped
to write has done some extraordinarily
good things we should be proud of that
we can go further and I believe that we
should move to Medicare for All
single-payer program
leadership is a bow is not just swimming
with the current it's not just coming up
blood
ideas when there is a majority support
for those ideas
before it was fashionable in the early
nineteen nineties congressman Burdick
said oppose nafta and other trade
agreements
corporate America to invest in this
country
create jobs in this country not just in
China
i voted against the so-called Defense of
Marriage Act
and I believe that people have a right
to love whoever they want regardless of
their child
nineteen nineties what all kinds of
people in this country republicans and
yes some Democrats said we should
deregulate Wall Street what a great idea
it would be if commercial banks and
insurance and commercial banks that
invested bags and insurance companies
could merge I didn't think it was such a
good idea
helped lead the opposition to
deregulation
in 2000 and most important debate in
recent history on foreign policy took
place
George W Bush Dick Cheney
they say
it was a good idea to invade Iraq
I listen very carefully to what they
said I didn't believe them I not only
voted against that wall I helped lead
the opposition to that war
standing up and be counted when the
times are rough when you are in a
minority situation also producing the
goods passing legislation that impacts
the people of the Hampshire for a month
and in america of the Veterans Committee
I helped pass the most comprehension of
veterans healthcare legislation passed
in the modern history of this country
not only help millions of veterans all
over this country get better access to
VA health care it was of particular
benefit to the veterans of the state of
New Hampshire
language in the bill that benefit
Hampshire veterans and I I am proud that
is part of the Affordable Care Act
twelve billion dollars in it to expand
community house and North Hampshire and
Vermont and all over this country
past one of the most significant pieces
of environmental legislation putting
billions of dollars to help communities
become less energy efficient and move to
sustainable energy
this no president not Bernie Sanders or
anybody else can bring about the changes
that the middle class and working
families of this country desperately
need and the reason for that is that the
powers that be
Wall Street corporate America the
corporate media the Koch brothers the
large coke campaign don't use so
powerful so powerful that the only way
we create the change that we need is
through a political revolution
millions and millions of people
throughout our country including many
who have given up on the political
process many who think their vote their
voice no longer matters
those people have got to re-engage
politically working people
low-income people young people and with
a loud voice a loud voice
voice heard on Tuesday in the Hampshire
and heard all over this country voice
which says that this couple hours for it
and defended by so many men and women
who prepared to put their lives on the
line this government of ours belongs to
all of us not a handful of wealthy
campaign contributors
