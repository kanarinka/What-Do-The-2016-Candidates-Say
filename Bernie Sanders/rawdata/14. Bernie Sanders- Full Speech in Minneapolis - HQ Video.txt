Tuesday
always thought all informally to go on a
campaign to my hometown
a Burlington Vermont we are over 5,000
people government-held
never want to go ahead sure standing
room only in a bed after bed
after that last couple days when you
know I was just looking for the very
worst lots
handbook and what we're doing here today
and video the
so I think it is a to say it
that we are all to ensure all start-up
in this if you have a name a campaign
which is calling for
a political revolution they're just like
the
now little water 30 and this is what I
mean from the bottom of my heart
and also with everything that I believe
them intellectually
I heard the jams burning burning burning
and I appreciate that
but this is not about burning it really
is about you
and when I just bought a lot of
political revolution what everybody has
got on the slant
is not the only other classes and their
representatives in Washington on
so-called
that the best president in the world
cannot the
level all we need a mass movement of
millions of people with
the
the movement at all anymore stands all
it says loudly and clearly you that this
great nation on the house and our
government
belonged to Albany bowl and not just a
head cold
affiliate the
this country today the
faces more serious problems than at any
time since the Great Depression
and if you throw in if you add to that
the planetary prices %uh climate change
it
the problems today maybe even mall
Syrians and here is my promise to you
for this game today
not only will I quite to protect the
working families in this country
I'm but we all going to build
AP permanent move it in this country in
which we are going to the standoff
and final at and we're going to do that
not necessarily with millions of
30-second TV ads
we got the goal directly to the people
in meetings like that
the
and with your help we're going to be
knocking on doors
all over Minnesota all over america
level
and we're going to be doing our very
best didn't know working
families in this country that they
cannot continue 2000 he more working
night and day
I guess they are all less the
I no longer than I expected
the poet lowly an excellent all
at all over the body is mostly okay a
bottle or a lawyer all does the world
class
the bullet people rodeo
what you think in a way yeah 720
the
hey not solid challenge
massive education massive of catalyzing
headway we say get understanding yes but
we're never going to view on this issue
or that is true nobody is gonna be a
hundred percent
whatever you but we were you working
families together to say
we want our kids to be able to get a
good education
these jobs the shit out of him nobody
will stop on the
let me just very briefly very briefly
give you an overview of some of the
issues
there we are gonna be campaigning on to
my mind I'm
the most significant issue we face
is the world's best level often
commonweal
getting quality in america the
in america today %um we have more
in calm and wealth inequality than any
other major industrialized country on
earth
and it is worse today that any time
since nineteen the 20 know I know
years to overwhelm and income inequality
is the great moral you're still up on
him
it is a great economic gives you all the
time
it is a great political if you all out
of time
and we are gonna do. got into the
and my only aim be very clear about this
let me tell this
to the billionaire lol class that today
has it all
there is something profoundly wall
when the hard-won yeah all along
per se not 100 percent want to help one
percent
also also supports well as a lot of
ninety percent
they are resolving roles loudly wall
when not even be not lying were said
although income generated two-day
goal at the heart one of his own there
is something profoundly wall
when in recent years we have seen a
proliferation
up millionaires and billionaires while
the average American is working
water well as below last year's and we
have the highest rate of childhood
bloody
largo de Majo country on earth
there is something profoundly ruled
wind warning family in this country
almost as much as well as a lot on all
million Americans this
world-class level updating them all and
wealth inequality
is bad economics it is unsustainable
and this is what my upbringing economy
which america is not so but also
totally hot I'll this is not the James
the
Edward what you'll look at all it is
gonna change
because we are going to create an
account a million that works for all
bball and not just a handful of people
on the Tom
the
but it is not just incall and wealth
inequality is more than that
today in America local what we are
seeing is that all will last
quality you years last 40 years
great middle-class of this country
once the head be up to you by a world
has been disappearing the today
despite expanded my knowledge an
explosion
%uh technology and huge increase in
worker productivity
median family income is almost five
thousand dollars less
that it was in ninety 99
in my state overload and I'm short
minutes old
we have many more working not just one
job to job
three jobs trying to cobble together in
a column
and some pellicano that is not what this
economy
it's almost like they allow the
gruza the automobile i'm in in america
is not quite like four or so it's not
the
officials that is like don't you see we
got to go
the paywall if you include those people
who have given up looking for work
and all those people working part-time
real unemployment in america today
is close to 11 presided you got
unemployment is seventy percent
african-american you love like that is
all good thoughts
today jangling
we have applauded by billion people
who are living in poverty and many of
them all working
forty or fifty hours alway
today
today we all live it
in a day should which has more well
then any shouldn't in the history
%uh the world but the problem here
that all will all that well
is going to go ahead well up people home
dots room is that in the last 30 years a
there has been a eulogy redistribution
well a it as a dog with a little
class done a very rich
and what we are saying today is it not
only is the No
we want not well the cod black the
working families
of the
now let me know much alone may not fully
healed
that is a huge consequences for our
country
and let me be as blunt as I can tell you
one
as I can be in the Holy Name you like
many of you already know
and that is as a result of the
disastrous Supreme Court decision
on citizens united the American
political says the has been slowly
corrupted
and the well you should pull American
democracy
got the
what the supreme court house actually
set
to the wealthiest people in this country
the billionaire class
what is it is are you guys already own
mucho you gonna be
now we're going to give you the
opportunity to all
the United States government and state
governments all
this country I'm and that is precisely
what these people on now trying to do
american democracy is not allow home
billionaires being able to live
candidates
and elections it is not about the Koch
brothers
Sheldon Adelson and other incredibly
wealthy individuals
spending billions and billions of
dollars to elect candidates
who will make the rich richer and
everybody else
moral there was recently a media report
which is just that the whole world is
themselves
one of them second wealthiest American
12 family name will spend more money
in this election cycle then I will the
Democratic Party
all the republican party brothers and
sisters
that is not a democracy not cool
paula coughlin the
and when we talk about the major issues
facing our country and in fact
facing the world I'm when we talk about
our responsibility uses human beings
and as it turns a lot got want kids and
seven grandchildren
there is nothing more important then
leaving this country
end this planet in a way that is
inhabitable
for our kids and all branches of the
go home told me is all
the scientific community is virtually
unanimous
climate change Israel climate change is
caused by human activity
climate change is already causing
devastating problems
in our country and around the world
and if we do not get our act together
in years the car the situation will be
substantially world
what the scientists are telling us if we
allow businesses to go on as usual
by the end of this century the planet
/url could be buying to defend it really
is
paradigm wall of more riled
more floods more extreme weather
disturbances
more rising sea levels mauled minnesota
became shouldn't
more diamond more disease more human
suffering
we meeting must not allow got to happen
the
hacksaw mold all the big oil companies
in the Koch brothers a make a lot of
money and possible
you all day one on not to address this
issue 1
but we all understand that is caretakers
all our environment as many people who
enjoy a little Union
all our country and the planet we are
not going to allow them
do the following this blood but their
short term profits
the
know what are the challenges that we
face that it is a huge
time you know I'm
is that the american people want very
disillusioned
with the political muscles they are very
demoralized
in the last midterm elections
sixty-three percent
well people didn't bowl he
resigned young people the lovable
and all over this country people are
hurting
they're worried about their kids they're
worried about their parents
so worried about what happens to the win
the gold and we look to washington and
leasing
be those people they're not dealing with
the realities
my like and they listen to the media on
the television logo lol political gossip
are all kinds the ground and not talking
about the realities facing
ordinary Americans media looking at
politics is a war a baseball game was so
lopsided home
rather than addressing the issues as to
how we transform America what we need to
do in my view
you know the with your home and we have
a website which is
going to get better in bed at school
Bernie Sanders like um we want your
ideas we want your feedback is we'll go
together but
a sexually what we need to do use
creative in the region
very clear Jenn that makes sense to
working families
all over this country as to what I'm the
government should be doing
to transform our country. and improve
lives rolling
what I wanted to know in a few minutes
you would you really luv pretty quickly
young
I want to watch along well I think could
be innocent who will all be progressive
agenda on
and the person who now wield is when you
want to be when you want to be with you
do polls
what people always say when you ask them
what is the most important thing on
their minds
it so you cool little whirlwind gold
jobs
jobs and the reason they say that is the
No
that unemployment is much too long they
worry about the kids being able to get a
decent job
they worry that the usability they're
gonna be delayed a long time
and not be able to get a job that pays
them in half the wages they're currently
burning
so in my view we need the media room
federal jobs program degrees millions
apiece and then jobs the
now
and and a hole-in-one our infrastructure
is crumbling
1l rules out which is all water systems
always what our plans are at once I will
I'll let you use and what they mean
enormous amount to were a little
we ought not to invest happily and
in Wheeling this infrastructural and
when we do let
we make this country moral should what
would dilute
and save money and we can create with
the $1 trillion dollar investment which
I have a proposal up to 30 million
these many Jones the
to
little here is not only a marginal
creating jobs which we have to do it is
a question of saving and preserving jobs
you are looking at a United States I
don't know
who was voted against trade agreements
like nafta the
I voted against nafta you have to
remember the normal trade relations with
China I'm
and I'm gonna help lead his opposition
against the trans-pacific partnership
the
it smoothens that since 2001
in vermont in minnesota ran all over
this country we have lost
almost six the thousand back two reasons
and millions on these and many jobs we
all
who rawlins trade agreements that every
corporation in America and the drug
companies
and will bring wide open and when their
goal
is the greatest situation with a good
shot done in america
and we'll do low-wage countries an hour
job is done lol
that we want trade agreements the
wholesale for american workers
and workers on the board that we want
them to start creating jobs
in america auto not just good other
countries around the world the
and when we leave more lol the economy
when we talk about the economy
let's all hope in Clio that millions of
American workers all working good wages
on
what's not much much bloom lolol
the
welcome our earnings middle mobile
federal minimum wage
%uh seven dollars and twenty five
insights into how well
is a starvation wage we've got a razor
what a living wage the
as some of you may know the city of los
Angeles is a
recently raise the minimum wage there
are 15 bucks an hour over her in a few
years but not exactly but like a
for the we must obligate pay equity
for women workers the
it is in government support there is a
lot acceptable the women doing the same
work as men
make 78 cents on the dollar that's got
to change.
Ste
and we'll talk with whom respect and the
working people of this country in Olin
every worker in america auto
has been a bit sick leave bank guarantee
but he should buy
the
now when we deal with an incall in
wealth inequality what we have to
understand that
is not just another well-used people in
this country and the largest
corporations are doing phenomenally well
what we also have do understand is that
we have
8 axis global with his written by these
very same
we will and it's grossly on them so let
me be very clear
11 000 all the billionaires who watching
that the the
diploma like did the president know it
was not named
your fair share the
we have that you could believe this
we haven't had this is the Loom
which allow those you who demand model
what reasons
the stash their money in the Cayman
Islands Bermuda
lot summer other perhaps aliens
then you know you have any time
somalis long profitable operations
bathes the rule in federal income tax
and we are losing
well over $100 billion dollars every
year
because all this packs loom
Warren beloved one of the richest guy is
in the world
reminds us often that he be more like
billionaire
glaze and the fact that why you real
acts were you which is lower than his
secretary is
lower lip truck drivers and lolol then
knows at a time when the wealthy use the
more like the one with the nominally
well
when we have a massive income and wealth
in a while a team
when we have a huge on merit social
needs do you know who will start with me
they and their children of the
and getting back into campaign finance
reform in this disaster Supreme Court
decision let me just say this I said it
before and I'll say it again
if elected president there will be a
litmus test
for my nominees to the United States
Supreme Court
and that is they will hold your business
tourism
human
with
know somebody who made the moment so
move you may not know
James bloom the United States of America
called
today it is the only major
country on hurled that does not
guarantee how would you know
do all the ball as you like and
