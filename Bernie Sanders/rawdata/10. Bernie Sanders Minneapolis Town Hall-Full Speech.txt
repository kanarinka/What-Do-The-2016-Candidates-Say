more in calm in wealth inequality than
any other major industrialized country

responsibility uses human beings
and is in terms of God want kids and
seven grandchildren

unanimous
climate change Israel
climate change is caused by human
activity
climate change is already causing
devastating
problem in our country and around the
world
any we do not get our act together
in years the car said will be
substantially worse
what does not telling us if we allow
business at all usual by
yen-dollar this treated wanted
could be by degrees paradigm
wall of more wild more
world more extreme weather served
more rising sea level mall said
more min more disease more
uelman's operated we must
not I'll happen
X Bowl big oil companies in the Koch

the social but we all those his
caretakers
all our environment as the people who
enjoy
you all our country and the planet
we on our going while to destroy this
planet
but their short term moments
what are the challenges that we face
huge
unique home is that the american people
want very disillusioned
with the political muscles they are very
demoralized
in the last midterm elections
sixty-three percent
well people didn't bowl he
resigned young people lovable
and all over this country people walk
they're worried about the kids they
worried about their parents
the word about what happens to the win
the gold
and we look to washington and Lisa pay
those people
they're not dealing with the realities
my like and they listen to the EU
television global political gossip all
kinds the ground and not talking about
the realities facing
ordinary Americans media looking at
politics as a war
baseball game was so well rather than
addressing
issues we transform America what we need
to do in my view
you know the with your help and we have
a website which is
going to get better and political Bernie
Sanders like are we want your like to
use we want your feedback as we work
well together but
a sexually what we need to do use create
engine
clear jed me examines the working
families
all this country as to what the
government should be doing
to transform our country. and improve
lives well
what I wanted to know in a few minutes
lil
pretty quickly your I want to watch
online would like
the innocent more be progressive agenda
and the person who
I'll is when you to all the people you
want to be when we do polls
what people would say when you ask them
what is the most important thing on
their minds
it's evil little world more jobs
jobs and the reason they say that is the
No
that unemployment is much too long they
worry about the kids being able to get a
decent job
they were relieved to be there gonna be
label
and not be able to get a job that pays
them have the wages that currently
burning
so in my view weenie
medium rule jobs program
the grease millions a decent paying jobs
and at a time when our infrastructure is
crumbling
10 rules out which is all water systems
always
plans no airport I will I'll let the
user know them million in almost a mile
a word we are not doing as
happened in we believe it is impersonal
and when we do and we make this country
moral
should walk do and sleep well and we can
agree with the $1 trillion dollar
investment
with higher proposed what to order
million
these Jones
you too slowly
marginal greeley jewels which we have to
do
it is a question of saving and preserve
jobs
you are looking at the United States on
who was born again trade agreements like
the
500 after you have to remember the
normal trade relations with China
and I'm gonna help leaders opposition
against the trans-pacific partnership
proved that since 2001
in vermont Minnesota are all over this
country we have more
almost six the thousand factories
and millions of babies and jobs where
you'll
who rolls trade agreement record should
America and the drug companies
and will reminded in with the hollywood
is a great situation with a good shot
down with America
and moved to countries an hour job is
the hell
that we want trade agreements all for
american workers
workers good we would
really jobs in america nachos
good the
and when we more well the economy when
we talk about the economy
let also quickly on that millions of
American workers are working good
what's not much much to wall
middleman federal minimum wage
%uh seven dollars and what the by sites
and I'll
is a stop should we've got a raise
work wage
so you may know the city walls edgewood
recently raised the minimum wage there
15 bucks an hour or more in a few years
exactly
good
for we must stop equity
for women workers the
been built here's a look at some of the
older women doing the same work
his bed make 78 cents on the dollar
that's got changed
and we'll talk respect
working with people of this country know
that every worker in america
as exactly and guarantee
but should
now we deal with an incall in wealth
inequality what we have to understand
is not just well-used people in this
country
in the largest corporations are doing
phenomenally well
what we also have do understand is that
we have
a acts is a global which is written by
these very same people
and it's grossly on there so let me be
very clear
and let me know all the people you know
watching like the vid
if elected he ignored
we you believe
we haven't taxes I'll
