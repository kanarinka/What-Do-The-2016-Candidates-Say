OTHER CANDIDATES, OKAY?

TO DO REALLY WELL THERE BECAUSE 
I'M HERE A LOT AND IT'S SO 
BEAUTIFUL AND I LOVE IT SO MUCH 
AND I LOVE THE PEOPLE AND I SAID
I ACTUALLY THINK THEY LIKE ME A 
LOT AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE 
STARTED GETTING NUMBERS IN AND 
EVERYONE SAID HOW COME THEY LIKE
TRUMP SO MUCH BUT I HAVE SO MANY
FRIENDS UP HERE AND THEY ARE 
SPECIAL, SPECIAL PEOPLE.
SO, NEW HAMPSHIRE, I WANT TO 
THANK YOU.
WE LOVE YOU.
WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK A LOT.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO FORGET YOU.
YOU STARTED IT.
REMEMBER, YOU STARTED IT.
UP 
YOU KNOW, WHEN I CAME OUT, I 
HEARD THE END OF BERNIE AS 
SPEECH AND SOME OF THE 
BEGINNING.
NO, NO, FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE TO
CONGRATULATE HIM.
WE MAY NOT LIKE IT.
I HEARD PART OF BEIRNE AS 
SPEECH.
HE WANTS TO GIVE AWAY OUR 
COUNTRY, FOLKS.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET IT 
HAPPEN.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING 
WITH BERNIE.
WE WISH HIM A LOT OF LUCK.
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA 
GREAT AGAIN UP WE'RE GOING TO 
DID IT THE OLD FASHIONED WAY.
WE'RE GOING TO BEAT CHINA, 
JAPAN, BEAT MEXICO AT TRADE.
WE'RE GOING TO BEAT ALL OF THESE
COUNTRIES THAT ARE TAKING SO 
MUCH OF OUR MONEY AWAY FROM US 
ON A DALY BASIS.
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE
BEEM H
.
WE HAVE THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN 
THE WORLD.
WE HAVE POLITICAL HACKS 
NEGOTIATING OUR DEALS FOR 
BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE.
WE'RE GOING TO USE THE FINEST 
BUSINESS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.
WE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING SO 
GOOD AND SO FAST AND SO STRONG 
AND THE WORLD IS GOING TO 
RESPECT US AGAIN, BELIEVE ME.
WE'RE GOING TO -- DO WE LOVE OUR
COUNTRY?
DO WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY?
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT 
REALLY CAUGHT ON, IT'S VERY 
IMPORTANT, SELF-FUNDING MY 
CAMPAIGN.
EVERYBODY ON BOTH SIDES, AND YOU
KNOW I WAS SAYING TWO WEEKS AGO,
I SAID I DON'T THINK PEOPLE 
REALLY APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE I 
SEE ALL OF THIS MONEY BEING 
POURED INTO COMMERCIALS AND IT'S
NOT THEIR MONEY, IT'S SPECIAL 
INTEREST MONEY.
THIS IS ON BOTH SIDES, THE 
DEMOCRAT SIDE, THE REPUBLICAN 
SIDE.
MONEY JUST POURING INTO 
COMMERCIALS.
THESE ARE SPECIAL INTERESTS, 
FOLKS.
THESE ARE LOBBYISTS.
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT DON'T 
NECESSARILY LOVE OUR COUNTRY, 
THEY DON'T HAVE THE BEST 
INTERESTS OF OUR COUNTRY AT 
HEART.
WE WERE NOT GOING TO LET IT 
HAPPEN.
WE CAN'T.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
BHU
.
WHEN YOU SEE THE KIND OF DEALS 
MADE IN OUR COUNTRY, THEY'RE 
MADE FOR THEIR BENEFIT.
WE HAVE TO STOP IT.
FOR YOUR BENEFIT, WE'RE GOING TO
MAKE THE DEALS FOR THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE.
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I LOVE THESE SIGNS.
THEY'RE THE MOST IMAGINATIVE 
SIGNS.
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE GREAT DEALS,
WE'RE GOING TO REBUILD OUR 
MILITARY.
NOBODY -- NOBODY IS GOING TO 
MESS WITH US.
BELIEVE ME, NOBODY.
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR
VETS!
WHERE IS AL?
WHERE IS AL?
WE LOVE AL!
ALL RIGHT, AL?
GET UP HERE IF YOU CAN.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR 
VETS.
OUR VETS ARE TREATED HORRIBLY.
THEY'RE OUR GREATEST PEOPLE.
OUR VETS ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN 
CARE OF AND YOU REMEMBER THAT, 
EVERYBODY.
RIGHT?
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE STRONG, 
INCREDIBLE BORDERS AND PEOPLE 
ARE GOING TO COME INTO OUR 
COUNTRY BUT THEY'RE GOING TO 
COME IN LEGALLY.
LEGALLY.
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A WALL.
IT'S GOING TO BE BUILT.
IT'S NOT EVEN BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
IT'S NOT EVEN A DIFFICULT THING 
TO DO.
AND, BY THE WAY, FOR THE PEOPLE 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE WHERE YOU HAVE 
A FLTREMENDOUS PROBLEM WITH HERN
AND DRUGS, THE FIRST THING THEY 
MENTION PLEASE DO SOMETHING 
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH OF IT, 
IT'S SO CHEAP.
WE'RE GOING TO END IT.
WE'RE GOING TO END IT AT THE 
SOUTHERN BORDER.
IT'S GOING TO BE OVER.
AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK REALLY 
HARD TO GET THOSE PEOPLE THAT 
ARE SO ADDICTED OFF THE HABIT.
WE'RE GOING TO WORK LIKE HELL TO
TAKE CARE OF THE SITUATION.
IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM IN NEW 
HAMPSHIRE.
IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM ALL OVER OUR
COUNTRY.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE BORDERS 
GIVEN AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK 
WITH YOU PEOPLE TO HELP YOU 
SOLVE THAT VERY BIG PROBLEM AND 
WE'LL GET IT DONE.
[ CROWD CHANTING ]
>> THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
WHAT A GROUP OF PEOPLE.
AND ON TOP OF THIS GROUP, WE 
HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE
THAT CAN'T EVEN GET IN.
THAT'S WHEN WE HAVE, THOUSANDS 
OF PEOPLE.
HEALTH CARE.
WE'RE GOING TO REPEAL AND 
REPLACE OBAMA CARE.
IT IS A TOTAL DISASTER.
WE'RE REPEALING AND REPLACING 
OBAMA CARE.
IT'S GONE.
WE'RE GETTING RID OF COMMON 
CORE.
WE'RE GOING TO EDUCATION OUR 
CHILDREN LOCALLY.
WE EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN LOCALLY.
WE ARE GOING TO PRESERVE OUR 
VERY SACRED SECOND AMENDMENT.
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY MORE
CHIPPING AWAY AT OUR SECOND 
AMENDMENT.
IF WE HAD PROTECTION IN 
CALIFORNIA RECENTLY AND SO MANY 
OTHER PLACE, YOU COULD EVEN LOOK
TO PARIS.
PARIS HAS THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS 
IN THE WORLD.
FRANCE HAS THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS
IN THE WORLD.
THESE ANIMALS GO IN, THEY START 
SHOOTING, ONE, TWO, THREE, 130 
PEOPLE WITH MANY PEOPLE HORRIBLY
WOUNDED, HORRIBLY WOUNDED RIGHT 
NOW IN THE HOSPITAL.
IF THERE WERE BULLETS GOING IN 
THE OTHER DIRECTION, BELIEVE ME,
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A WHOLE 
DIFFERENT STORY, FOLKS.
BUT NOBODY HAD PROTECTION.
I AM GOING TO BE THE GREATEST 
JOBS PRESIDENT THAT GOD EVER 
CREATED.
REMEMBER THAT.
DON'T BELIEVE THOSE PHONY 
NUMBERS WHEN YOU HEAR 4.9 AND 5%
UNEMPLOYMENT.
THE NUMBER'S PROBABLY 28, 29, AS
HIGH AS 35.
IN FACT, I EVEN HEARD RECENTLY 
42%.
DO YOU HAVE THINK -- IF WE HAD 
5% UNEMPLOYMENT, DO YOU REALLY 
THINK WEED HAVE THESE 
GATHERINGS?
FORGETTING ABOUT SECURITY, 
FORGETTING ABOUT ISIS, WHICH, BY
THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO KNOCK THE
HELL OUT OF ISIS.
WE'RE GOING TO KNOCK THE HELL 
OUT OF THEM.
AND IT'S GOING TO BE DONE THE 
RIGHT WAY.
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF 
THE ECONOMY.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF 
JOBS, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE 
OF ALL OF.
THINGS THAT I SAID, OUR BORDER, 
HEALTH CARE.
IT'S GOING TO BE SO GREAT.
REMEMBER THIS ABOUT OBAMA CARE.
PEOPLE ARE FORGETTING BUT NOW 
THEY'RE MISERABLE BECAUSE IT'S 
GOING UP 45%, 35%, 55%.
IT'S TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL.
PROBABLY SINKING OF ITS OWN 
VOLITION IN 2017, UNLESS THE 
REPUBLICANS GIVE IT ANOTHER -- I
MEAN, WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S GOING ON?
THE BUDGET.
THE LAST BUDGET THAT WAS 
APPROVED IS AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER
FOR EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY.
WEEP OWE $19 TRILLION AS OF 
TODAY.
WEEP JUST CROSSED THE $19 
TRILLION MARK.
WE'RE GOING TO VERY SHORTLY BE 
AT $ 21 TRILLION BECAUSE OF THE 
BUDGET.
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY
SO STRONG.
WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING 
AGAIN.
AS A COUNTRY WE DON'T WIN ON 
TRADE, WE DON'T WIN WITH THE 
MILITARY, WE CAN'T BEAT ISIS.
WE DOESN'T WIN WITH ANYTHING.
WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING 
AGAIN AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN SO 
MUCH, YOU ARE GOING TO BE SO 
HAPPY, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE 
AMERICA SO GREAT AGAIN, MAYBE 
GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE.
